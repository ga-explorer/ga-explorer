<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he area of <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_visualization" target="_blank">Scientific Visualization</a> (SciViz)</strong> is an interdisciplinary branch of science. According to <a href="http://www.math.yorku.ca/SCS/Gallery/milestone/milestone.pdf" target="_blank">Friendly</a>, it is &#8220;primarily concerned with the visualization of three-dimensional phenomena (architectural, meteorological, medical, biological, etc.), where the emphasis is on realistic renderings of volumes, surfaces, illumination sources, and so forth, perhaps with a dynamic (time) component&#8221;. It is also considered a subset of computer graphics, a branch of computer science. The purpose of scientific visualization is to graphically illustrate scientific data to enable scientists to understand, illustrate, and glean insight from their data.</p>
<p>In this post, I interview Dr. Werner Benger who describes his views on SciViz using Geometric Algebra and provides valuable insights about the use of SciViz in Big Data applications.</p>

He worked on the design and development of the Vish Visualization Shell for Scientific Visualization of Big Data. Vish is designed to be suitable for scientific big data from any kind of application domain by using a generic data model. Within the context of AHMS, it is used for topo-bathymetric datasets from LIDAR measurements.</p>
<p>Dr. Werner Benger has a scientific background in astrophysics. His main research is in the area of Generic Visualization methods based on mathematical models for multidisciplinary applications, with a special focus on astrophysics and computational fluid dynamics. The applied methods are based on Differential Geometry, Geometric Algebra, Topology, and Fiber Bundles. His current special focus is on iso topo-bathymetric data via his work in AHMS.</p>

<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Tell us about your primary research interest: Scientific Visualization (SciViz). Why have you chosen to work in this field?</strong></span></p>
<p><a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/4_cr.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-2" title=""><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2653" src="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/4_cr-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/4_cr-300x300.jpg 300w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/4_cr-150x150.jpg 150w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/4_cr-160x160.jpg 160w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/4_cr-320x320.jpg 320w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/4_cr.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Basically, there are three purposes of visualization of scientific data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Presentation (when all is known about the data),</li>
<li>Analysis (when some questions need to be answered about the data),</li>
<li>Exploration (when we have no clue about the data yet and want to find out something new).</li>
</ul>
<p>Although user interface design is not necessarily part of SciViz, but in many cases, interactivity is needed. Particularly important is that the data that one deals with here are those with a spatio-temporal nature, it&#8217;s not just &#8220;any&#8221; data, but this specific subset.</p>
<p>Actually, I would not say that I have chosen to work in SciViz. It&#8217;s more that SciViz has chosen me. For most of the time I&#8217;ve considered myself rather an astrophysicist that became &#8220;delinquent&#8221; by engaging with computers too much. The origin came from the question how a black hole actually looks like. I asked that questions to one of my professors at university and he could not answer it, so I had to find out myself. I wrote a computer program for that purpose and that got me into this field. A couple of years ago I gave a presentation to students telling this story, you can find <a href="https://www.cct.lsu.edu/~werner/4REU2010.pdf" target="_blank">the presentation slides here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Do you see significant differences between Engineering and Computer Science when trying to solve practical problems?</strong></span></p>
<p>As you mention Engineering vs. Computer Science &#8211; I often feel the difference between these two is that in Engineering you worry to get things to work &#8220;somehow&#8221;, while in Computer Science you also worry how things are getting to work and you want to find a systematic, future-safe approach. I&#8217;m myself more behind this theoretical approach to finding a powerful general solution that also but not only works for a special case, rather than just solving one particular special case. I also want to know why things work or why things cannot work, rather than finding an algorithm that solves a problem &#8220;somehow&#8221;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>What major branches of Engineering and Computer Science are directly related to SciViz research and applications?</strong></span></p>
<p><a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Fields.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-3" title=""><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2659" src="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Fields-300x107.jpg" alt="Fields" width="300" height="107" srcset="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Fields-300x107.jpg 300w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Fields.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>My own approach to scientific visualization is focusing on finding general methods that allow encapsulation and reuse of code and algorithms. Computer programmers are inherently lazy people; otherwise, they would not use computers. I&#8217;m no exception for that, and particularly lazy such that I want to implement an algorithm or data operation once, and not over and over again for similar data types. Consequently what is needed is one common concept that covers many cases under the same hood. I found that to be true through my background in astrophysics in General Relativity (GR); since this theory makes many otherwise implicit assumptions explicit.</p>
<p>The same is also true about Geometric Algebra, which &#8220;unfolds&#8221; otherwise collapsed mathematical entities, such as vectors and bivectors, and clearly states the properties of each object in a systematic way. So it is this unfolding and clarification of concepts via GA and GR (namely differential geometry and topology) that opens the path to a common data model that is powerful and reusable for those many cases that one encounters in scientific visualization. It is an overhead for a particular case, so many people who do their work under time-pressure or a close horizon don&#8217;t see the benefit of a more general data model, but in the longer term it is significantly less work and opens development resources towards more interesting topics rather than dealing with myriads of similar cases. Here is an article titled &#8220;<a href="https://www.computer.org/cms/Computer.org/ComputingNow/homepage/2009/1109/rW_CS_SafariFileFormatJungle.pdf" target="_blank">On Safari in the File Format Jungle</a>&#8221; that elaborates on this matter.</p>
<p>Systematic scientific visualization fuses all those interesting mathematical fields of differential geometry, topology, and geometric algebra. SciViz is also on the bridge between artwork and science, so touching both aspects is what many want, but only SciViz achieves if done well. You can read more about this aspect in my article &#8220;<a href="http://www.zib.de/hege/pdf/Benger-1999-Visions-of-numerical-relativity_SC-99-53.pdf" target="_blank">Visions of Numerical Relativity 1999</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">What recent SciViz developments you find most important that you can tell us about?</span></strong></p>
<p>Concerning new developments &#8211; that is certainly &#8220;Big Data&#8221;, which has become a buzzword that is all around now. With more and advanced numerical and observation technology available, the trend is to no longer filter data during generation, but to just retrieve and store anything possible, leaving the crucial problem of identifying &#8211; i.e., visualizing &#8211; the important aspects of the data to the last data processing step, the visualization. This is a topic by itself of course, but just to mention that Big Data is often considered synonymous with High-Performance Computing (HPC). Actually, SciViz only covers one aspect of HPC, but indeed many methods and approaches from HPC are needed to deal with SciViz, even on single PCs and laptops. There it is of course all about parallelism, about GPU computing, about parallel I/O, and about scaling up algorithms to deal with bigger amounts of data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Tell us about the relations between Geometric Computing (GC) and SciViz. How does SciViz benefit from developments in GC and the other way around? </strong></span></p>
<p>Geometric Computing is a tool that is used in SciViz to solve its various detail problems. It&#8217;s frequent that in SciViz you want to achieve something and you need to search for the best GC algorithm to solve it. For the other way around, SciViz may help to develop a GC algorithm as it allows visual insight to what actually happens during the algorithm, not merely the result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>What benefits can Geometric Algebra provide in this context for both domains? Do you find everyone agreeing with your point of view on using GA?</strong></span></p>
<p><a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/isostream03.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-4" title=""><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2655" src="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/isostream03-300x236.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="236" srcset="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/isostream03-300x236.jpg 300w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/isostream03-768x605.jpg 768w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/isostream03.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>I always try to solve a GC problem via GA since GA is much richer in expressiveness than linear algebra and the chances that a seemingly complex algorithm can be solved by some simple but powerful elements taken out of a GA &#8220;toolbox&#8221; are high. Once you are used to thinking in terms of GA, things become easier that way, and thinking in terms of linear algebra feels like a knot in the brain. Like when talking about a &#8220;normal vector&#8221;, which is not really a vector, it&#8217;s merely identified with a vector, but what is actually a better representation is a bivector algebraically describing a plane&#8217;s direction in space.</p>
<p>This sometimes leads to passionate discussions with colleagues who still think about geometry in linear algebra and wonder how to rotate around an axis in 3D, when it&#8217;s so much easier to think about a rotation in a plane spun by two vectors. Such GA-based representation does not require any thinking, you &#8220;just do it&#8221;. But it is so hard for people to think about a bivector when talking about a plane if they are used to think about a plane&#8217;s normal vector instead, which in fact is a construct involving orthogonality and orientation, much more complex than the original object, the plane itself.</p>
<p>But then, even GA complicates matters by considering bivectors as oriented planes, but there&#8217;s not really a concept of a plane &#8220;as-is&#8221;, i.e. without orientation. That is something that can be borrowed from differential geometry as a covector, an unoriented plane, which by means of using an orientation (via the pseudoscalar) is identifiable with a bivector, then describing an oriented plane. And all those items are identified in linear vector algebra with the same object, a three-component vector.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s a bit of matter of taste which side is more confusing, the one identifying different geometric concepts into the same algebraic representation, or the one that unfolds a widely used geometric concept into more expressive algebraic objects. For my taste, the latter, and the more you have unfolded those geometric concepts, the better you understand which algebraic structures are required for identification &#8211; and those structures may be non-trivial in general, thus need to be considered explicitly in a general-purpose data model, even though via various optimization techniques they would vanish. This should be the last step, not the first one. &#8220;Implicit assumptions&#8221; are the death of data descriptions and file formats, there must at least be a way to identify which assumptions have been made, and they need to be part of the data description.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>What is the importance of embedding the assumptions into Big Data descriptions and file formats? How can we approach this effectively?</strong></span></p>
<p>When we classify algebraic properties of geometric concepts we obtain a &#8220;zoo&#8221; of vector types. This determines the metadata that needs to be written to a file (or other means of persistent storage such as a database) such that the data remain identifiable. Just writing floating point data is simple, but problems occur when the need arises to know what the data mean when reading them. Self-description of data is important for archival purposes and restartable algorithms, which are particularly important for long-term archiving and out-of-memory data processing. There are not many file formats that even provide the required expressivity of meta-data as required for this purpose to describe such variety of vectorial types.</p>
<p><a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/TensorFibers-F5Logo.png" data-rel="lightbox-5" title=""><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2657" src="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/TensorFibers-F5Logo.png" alt="TensorFibers-F5Logo" width="256" height="256" srcset="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/TensorFibers-F5Logo.png 256w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/TensorFibers-F5Logo-150x150.png 150w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/TensorFibers-F5Logo-160x160.png 160w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/TensorFibers-F5Logo-320x320.png 320w" sizes="(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px" /></a>XML is one option, especially in the web context, <strong><a href="https://www.hdfgroup.org/" target="_blank">HDF5</a></strong> is another one, designed for high-performance applications and big data. While via XML anything is in the open, in HDF5 there already is an API to describe the properties of types. In Addition, HDF5 provides functionality of type conversions, which in this context can be utilized to e.g. implicitly convert multivectors of different numerical precision or to read a partial multivector into full multivector (for instance, if data were written by an application that only knows about vectors, but later on these data are read into another application that only knows about full multivectors).</p>
<p>For a generic application, we need runtime type identification that maps a type description, may it be provided by HDF5 or another capable file format \ storage medium, into compile-time types such that the correct precompiled code for the respective vector types can be called. On the other hand, the I/O mechanisms should not need to know about the complexity of vector types, it only needs to know about arrays of floating points plus some metadata. Thus what is left is to map the compile-time type meta-information to some run-time meta-information about types. The mechanism of type traits comes into play here for writing data. For reading data, however, it is not sufficient. When a certain data type is identified in some persistent storage, the reading code has to look up some registry to find a routine that produces actual instances of data arrays of the given type (which is then known by application code only). Given such an application code produced data array, it remains sufficient for the reading code to look at its numerical values only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>As I understand, SciViz is a core part of any practical simulator. In your opinion, what are the software engineering methods most suitable for designing and implementing scalable SciViz software components and systems? </strong></span></p>
<p><a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Streamlines_Multiblock6.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-6" title=""><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2650" src="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Streamlines_Multiblock6-300x188.jpg" alt="Streamlines_Multiblock6" width="300" height="188" srcset="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Streamlines_Multiblock6-300x188.jpg 300w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Streamlines_Multiblock6-768x480.jpg 768w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Streamlines_Multiblock6.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Well, in theory, it&#8217;s a complementary part of simulation; in practice many scientists performing 3D or 4D simulations still only look at numbers or 1D plots. This is partly due to &#8220;old-style&#8221; scientists being used to 1D plots, as this was the only way of &#8220;visualization&#8221; decades ago, and color printing of images with 3D visualizations is not possible in traditional high-profile journals where they want to publish. The other problem is the inconvenience of dealing with big data and advanced visualization systems. While there are lots of fancy visualization equipment such as Caves and Walls, only very few would make use of such. The typical scientist would not make use of anything that doesn&#8217;t run on their laptops right away. Even going to another room for doing visualization on a higher-end machine is too much overhead for many &#8220;end-users&#8221; and they would not do it unless they are forced to.</p>
<p>For design and engineering of SciViz software, I&#8217;m an advocator for using a common data model. I.e., use one central data structure to route as many types of data through this one, instead of cooking many little solutions that may or may not fit together.</p>
<p>Concerning code readability, I believe code should be written in a most intuitive way; mathematical algorithms as close to the mathematical notation as possible. For example, operator overloading and C++ 14 string literals provide syntactic sugar to do so, but a naive implementation may suffer performance issues. Expression templates have demonstrated how human-readable code can be transformed into efficient code by using C++ templates. The more constraints are known about some code, the better it can be optimized, and systems such as Gaalop or GMac that rely on symbolic algebra packages may be able to optimize a certain algorithm even better than the more generic C++ compiler. It is thus desirable that a C++ library providing GA algorithm allows for application code that is not only human-readable but also readable as a domain-specific language such that it is parseable by tools beyond the C++ compiler itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>How can GA be useful in this software design context? Are there any difficulties associated with using GA here?</strong></span></p>

The difficulty here is similar to using a common data model: we need the most general possible way of considering GA, not merely a version of GA for one particular case, even though that one may be very broadly used.</p>
<p>For instance, this means considering GA in arbitrary coordinate systems, not merely in orthonormal coordinate systems, which is what most implementations of GA do &#8211; because mathematically, it can be done, and the problem is solved thereby. But it&#8217;s only mathematically solved, and in practice, non-orthonormal coordinate systems are more common; for instance in numerical relativity or in computational fluid dynamic simulations. GA-based implementations need to be as general as possible to cover all such applications that can use GA as an algebraic representation. At the same time, we need to keep the highly optimized reductions that are possible for special cases, and at this time some automatic code generators may come into play to allow specifying constraints and knowledge available for a particular use case (e.g. global orthonormality of coordinates) which are not available on the level of a compiler.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>How do you think designing GA-based SciViz software, like your Vish Shell, for Big Data processing can be different from small scale GC applications?</strong></span></p>
<p><a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/VishConcept.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-8" title=""><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2649" src="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/VishConcept-300x279.jpg" alt="Vish Concept" width="300" height="279" srcset="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/VishConcept-300x279.jpg 300w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/VishConcept.jpg 482w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>A certain difference is that one must avoid any overhead &#8220;per vector element&#8221; and consider doing operations on &#8220;arrays of multivectors&#8221;. This comes with constraints that need to be taken into consideration. Vish stems from a background of dealing with big data from numerical relativity and bases all its data operations on the concept of fiber bundles. This means operations are done as array operations as much as possible, which are parallelizable and allow optimal data throughput, for both I/O and transferring data on the graphics card for rendering. Modern rendering is based on vertex buffers and vertex arrays, which mathematically are fiber bundles, whereas the old OpenGL 1.0 was about primitives and lists of primitives. This model did not scale to the highly parallel data processing that happens on GPUs and thus is considered deprecated now, whereas the fiber bundle data model, envisioned originally by D. Butler in 1989, shines, even though only a few people are aware that they actually do fiber bundles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>What role does GA have in such Big-Data software design context?</strong></span></p>
<p>In this context, GA is complementary, as it basically implements fibers on the fiber bundle data model. So the basic change is to think about operations on arrays of multivectors and to extend solutions to consider array operations instead of single variables. Now that &#8220;should&#8221; be rather easy when an array of multivectors is homogenous, i.e. each array element consists of multivectors with the same zero and non-zero components. Fortunately, this will most likely be the case in practical applications, and code-generators such as GMac are able to predict which multivector components will always be zero within an algorithm &#8211; that is an essential part of applying GA algorithms for big data, both for computational speed and even more memory consumption.</p>
<p>For a single input operation, optimizing out zeroes is just some computational optimization, but the algorithm would still work without it. For big data having many inputs, keeping arrays which are all zero are performance killers and may prevent an entire application from becoming functional. So an optional optimization for small data applications becomes a mandatory component for big data applications. But things become really complex if we had to consider heterogeneous multivector arrays where the zeros would be different at each array element. This basically leaves us with two options: Carry all zeroes everywhere for the sake of parallelism, or use locally dynamic multivectors, which will be much slower but more memory-friendly. Let&#8217;s hope we don&#8217;t have many such application cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Can you tell us about other interesting aspects of Vish?</strong></span></p>
<p>I would like to point out that Vish is adhering to <a href="http://vish.fiberbundle.net/download/license/" target="_blank">a particular license with a non-military aspect</a>. I think it&#8217;s important for developers of technology to also think how their technology can be used. Otherwise, the Oppenheimer effect may strike them later on. Many people would object, and promote &#8220;free software&#8221; just for the sake of freedom, saying the military would not respect a software license anyway. However, my experience on that matter has been just the opposite. It is respected, and I had a couple of requests from the military that I was putting down, and it was accepted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>You mentioned earlier that most scientists don&#8217;t like to use advanced SciViz tools often. What can we do in terms of educating and training new generations of researchers to change this? Can GA provide help in solving this problem?</strong></span></p>
<p><a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Rayleigh-Taylor_instability.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-9" title=""><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2662" src="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Rayleigh-Taylor_instability-300x300.jpg" alt="Rayleigh-Taylor_instability" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Rayleigh-Taylor_instability-300x300.jpg 300w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Rayleigh-Taylor_instability-150x150.jpg 150w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Rayleigh-Taylor_instability-160x160.jpg 160w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Rayleigh-Taylor_instability-320x320.jpg 320w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Rayleigh-Taylor_instability.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>This is a good and unsolved question. Actually, I don&#8217;t think much can be done to change the mind of current researchers, but new ones will embrace new technology in a natural way, similar to kids growing up with smartphones, while their grandparents still disapproving them. Parts of the process is due to the technology not just becoming functional, but also easy and available to use.</p>
<p>There is not much point of trying to &#8220;force&#8221; users into some technology, that is not really sustainable, but there are many people out there that would want to make their technology to be used and available, yet they struggle with the simple issue of obtaining funding for it, because in the scientific world, you don&#8217;t get papers and publications for making your software easier to use. It&#8217;s more the scientific publication culture, or rather, using &#8220;scientific publications&#8221; as a measure for funding agencies that inhibits making such tools easier. SciViz, in particular, has the problem that everyone wants and likes glossy images to present and sell their work, but hardly anyone wants to invest resources into it or pay for it. There are few exceptions, for instance, I heard about research centers with the policy that 10% of all project budgets must be allocated for doing visualization; this is a great model. By that model, even projects that don&#8217;t need visualization contribute to visualization research and deployment. With a proper funding model for SciViz development and supplementing, development and increased use of advanced SciViz tools will come naturally.</p>
<p>On the other hand, GA is more an educational topic, it does not really help to understand a data analysis in its entity, it could only help to understand a certain data analysis tool or method, to see what it does. But understanding the data itself is independent, and that is up to the scientist who produced the data to determine whether GA is of benefit in this step. But similar to SciViz tools, there is no point of trying to enforce or promote GA to those who don&#8217;t want it, but those who don&#8217;t know it yet should be made aware that it exists and what it is good for, and that should be done as early as possible in someone&#8217;s learning career. Of course, the problem is that it comes with a choice &#8211; it can be used or not, so to not burden people with unnecessary mental ballast, it would not be taught early on. But at least, it should be mentioned, so people inspired by it can look it up themselves.</p>

<blockquote><p>There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult. &#8212; C. A. R. Hoare.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="dropcap">P</span>lanning for the next generation of GMac began in August 2011. I started to design the new version of GMac from scratch by reading significant parts of Terence Parr&#8217;s book &#8220;<a href="https://pragprog.com/book/tpdsl/language-implementation-patterns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Language Implementation Patterns</a>&#8221; <sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-2531-1' id='enref-2531-1' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(2531)'>1</a></sup>, Robert W. Sebesta&#8217;s classic book &#8220;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Concepts-Programming-Languages-Robert-Sebesta/dp/0131395319" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Concepts of Programming Languages</a>&#8220;, and the second edition of the bestseller <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Book</a> &#8220;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Compilers-Principles-Techniques-Tools-2nd/dp/0321486811/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1486586482&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=compiler+design" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools</a>&#8220;. I had learned many lessons during developing the first GMac prototype. These books provided a solid conceptual framework for designing the new version of GMac containing all the lessons I&#8217;d learned before.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/index.php/2017/02/09/gmac-tng-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous post</a>, I talked about the first part of my journey developing GMac, the fascinating discoveries I made, and the difficulties I faced along the way. In this final part, I explain the design decisions I made for GMac and how I came to select them, in addition to the developments I hope to make in the future.</p>
<h3>Having a Symbolic Value</h3>
<blockquote><p>&#8230; with proper design, the features come cheaply. This approach is arduous, but continues to succeed. &#8211;Dennis Ritchie.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Equations.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-1" title=""><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2523" src="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Equations-300x200.jpg" alt="Equations" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Equations-300x200.jpg 300w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Equations.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>The first line of code I wrote was in the most basic of its foundations; namely the interface between GMac and a mathematical symbolic processing system like Mathematica. In addition, I created a library of utilities and basic data structures that grew over time called <strong>UtilsLib</strong>. I initially started out trying to design a single library that is capable of unifying and handling symbolic processing for a number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Computer Algebra Systems</strong></a> <strong>(CAS)</strong> like <a href="https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mathematica</a>, <a href="https://www.maplesoft.com/products/maple/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maple</a>, <a href="https://www.ptc.com/en/products/mathcad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mathcad</a>, <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SageMath</a>, <a href="http://maxima.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maxima</a>, etc. In order to create such class library, I would have to learn the basics of all these systems to abstract a common interface. This was a huge project by itself that would delay my dream considerably. I eventually concentrated on designing an Object Oriented (OO) interface to <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/language/NETLink/tutorial/Overview.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mathematica&#8217;s NET Link API</a> in the hope that I would have the time to expand it later to other symbolic processing systems.</p>
<p>Computer algebra systems mostly use homogeneous trees of objects, like Mathematica&#8217;s <a href="https://reference.wolfram.com/language/NETLink/ref/net/Wolfram.NETLink.Expr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Expr class</a>, to store information about <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/EverythingIsAnExpression.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the structure of all their expressions</a>. These homogenous trees are suitable for computer algebra but not easy to handle using OO design. This is a similar problem to needing an OO interface between tables in relational databases and the OO applications interacting with them, we call that the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_access_layer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data Access Layer</a> (DAL)</strong>.</p>
<p>The final result is my <strong><a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/index.php/gmac-math-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SymbolicInterface</a></strong> component class library, a kind of <strong>Symbolic Processing Access Layer (SPAL)</strong> to Mathematica. The main purpose of this library is to add low-level symbolic processing capabilities to GMac on symbolic scalars. A symbolic scalar is the most basic unit of computation that GMac can handle; it represents an expression that can be evaluated into a real number after substituting values into its symbolic variables if any are present. For example, all the following are basic symbolic scalars in GMac based on Mathematica syntax for symbolic expressions:</p>
<ul>
<li>-109</li>
<li>2.3456</li>
<li>Rational[6,11]</li>
<li>Pi</li>
<li>Sin[2*Pi/3]</li>
<li>Exp[-t/5]</li>
<li>x + 3 * Power[y, 2] &#8211; 5 x * y</li>
</ul>
<p>The restrictions on the Mathematica values and functions used in scalar expressions is that each value or function should be convertible into the target language in which code generation is desired. Each symbolic variable, like x, y, and t in the above expressions, should be associated with a data store in the target code; for example, a local variable, an array element, a class member, a named constant etc. Additional kinds of symbolic expressions with unified OO interfaces can be defined and evaluated like matrices, vectors, boolean expressions, rules, etc.</p>
<p>Using the SymbolicInterface classes I could now define basic operations on multivectors in any selected GA frame. I could define symbolic basis blades and their linear combinations using an approach similar to the one described in &#8220;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Geometric-Algebra-Computer-Science-Revised/dp/0123749425" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geometric Algebra for Computer Science</a>&#8220;. I could create and manipulate symbolic multivectors as linear combinations of basis blades with any given signature, even non-orthogonal ones like the 5D Conformal GA. The coefficients of these symbolic multivectors are symbolic scalars, not just numeric floating point numbers. I began implementing all standard operations on multivectors and blades like the geometric, outer, and inner products, inversions and involutions, outermorphisms, etc.</p>
<p>The SymbolicInterface classes are used extensively across all layers and components of GMac to communicate with Mathematica through a unified OO interface. This interface can be used in similar projects. I hope I could make it an open source component in the near future, if I could obtain proper funding for GMac, to be further developed by interested people. I also need to add automatic symbolic multivector differentiation to increase the range of applications that GMac can be used in.</p>
<h3>Being Specific</h3>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s OK to figure out murder mysteries, but you shouldn&#8217;t need to figure out code. You should be able to read it. &#8212; Steve McConnell.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Coding.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-2" title=""><img class="alignright wp-image-2526 size-medium" src="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Coding-300x200.jpg" alt="Coding" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Coding-300x200.jpg 300w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Coding.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>The next logical step to make was to design and implement the main user interface to the GMac system, its <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Domain Specific Language</a> (DSL)</strong>. One of the lessons I&#8217;d learned during my Ph.D. was that using sophisticated software systems requires a well-designed interface close to the user&#8217;s specific domain of knowledge, not the software engineer&#8217;s. Two approaches, DSLs and <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming_language" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visual Programming Languages</a> (VPLs)</strong>, are the best candidates for the job. A VPL can always be built around a DSL but would require an additional layer to visually interface with the user, So I decided to start with a simple Geometric Algebra based DSL <sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-2531-2' id='enref-2531-2' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(2531)'>2</a></sup>. I hope in the future I could implement a visual environment for GMac that can be used to define GA-models using visual GA-notation and relate the DSL&#8217;s components together visually.</p>
<p>It took a lot of experimentation and re-design, but the final result is <a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/index.php/gmacdsl-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>GMacDSL</strong></a>. The language design of GMacDSL is simple and focused on the domain; namely GA-based modeling. GMacDSL is not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turing-complete</a> because it doesn&#8217;t need to be. The main elements of GMacDSL are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Namespaces:</strong> These are simple logical named containers for the other elements of GMacDSL similar ti Java packages and C# namespaces.</li>
<li><strong>Frames:</strong> Using GMacDSL, the user can define any fixed set of named basis vectors along with their relative metric relations including Euclidean, Orthonormal, Orthogonal, and Non-orthogonal frames. Frames are the basic abstraction on which all subsequent symbolic computations occur inside GMac.</li>
<li><strong>Subspaces:</strong> A subspace is a set of basis blades of a given frame. They are useful in many cases for selecting or defining parts of multivectors during symbolic computations.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-defined Data Types:</strong> Two types are present in GMacDSL. Scalars are symbolic expressions of real values, including number literals. In addition, each frame automatically defines an associated Multivector type; a list of scalars defining a symbolic linear combination of the Frame&#8217;s basis blades.</li>
<li><strong>Structures:</strong> User-defined combinations of named members having given types including scalars, multivectors, or other structures. These are similar to user-defined types and structs in other languages. The main purpose of structures is to implement the pattern of <a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/index.php/2017/01/13/ga-computing3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geometric Generators</a> in GMacDSL.</li>
<li><strong>Constants:</strong> These are constant-valued named data containers of any type including scalars, multivectors, and structures. The scalar values inside constants can be large symbolic expressions; they needn&#8217;t be number literals.</li>
<li><strong>Fixed Outermorphisms:</strong> These are simple outermorphisms with fixed scalar elements that are mainly used to transform related frames. For example, we can define a non-orthogonal frame using an orthogonal one and an invertible change of basis matrix. Then GMac automatically defines two fixed outermorphisms to transform multivectors between the two frames.</li>
<li><strong>Multivector Expressions:</strong> The main function of GMac is to handle standard GA operations on symbolic multivectors. Multivector expressions provide this capability to define macros and construct constants.</li>
<li><strong>Macros:</strong> A macro in GMacDSL is the most important unit of computation. Simply speaking, a macro is a list of GA-based high-level computations on scalars, multivectors, and structures that produce a single value of any type from computations performed on a number of inputs, also of any type. A macro is not a procedure or function in the familiar way of common programming languages. A macro can only call other macros defined before it in the DSL code and allows no recursion.</li>
</ol>
<p>This structure is simple to understand and use for non-programmers working with GA models while being sufficient for covering many practical GA models. In the future, I hope to develop GMacDSL using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Functional Programming Paradigm</a>. This would provide elegant and powerful syntax and semantics for GA-based models that would take great benefit from GA&#8217;s unified and elegant mathematical abstractions.</p>

<p>In order to experiment with various designs of GMacDSL I had to implement a compiler to parse and translate GMacDSL code into a suitable intermediate data structure. In 2012, I began writing the <strong>GMacCompiler</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler#Front_end" target="_blank" rel="noopener">front-end</a> for that purpose. The first step in creating a typical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compiler</a> is to implement its parser. I initially tried to code my own parser using the elegant functional capabilities of <a href="http://fsharp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">F#</a> but I later found a much better solution called <strong><a href="http://irony.codeplex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Irony</a> </strong>by Roman Ivantsov <sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-2531-3' id='enref-2531-3' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(2531)'>3</a></sup>. Irony has many good features that attract computer language designers to use it as a base for their language tools. Using Irony I could easily parse GMacDSL code into a homogeneous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parse_tree" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Parse Tree</strong></a>. This parse tree is not useful by itself because it&#8217;s based on a context-free Irony Grammar, but it can be converted into a more useful <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abstract Syntax Tree</a> (AST)</strong> through <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compiler_design/compiler_design_semantic_analysis.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">semantic analysis</a>.</p>
<p>Based on Irony, I developed an infrastructure for creating simple DSLs. I call this infrastructure <strong>IronyGrammars </strong><sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-2531-4' id='enref-2531-4' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(2531)'>4</a></sup>; it provides many services needed by typical DSL compilers like source code handling, error and warning messages reporting, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_table" target="_blank" rel="noopener">symbol table</a> management, <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compiler_design/compiler_design_semantic_analysis.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">semantic analysis</a>, AST construction and navigation, interpretation services, etc. Naturally, the most difficult part of implementing the IronyGrammars infrastructure is the debugging. Many cycles of refactoring, testing, and debugging were made. The implementation finally settled in a relatively satisfying state after removing much code.</p>
<p>I used IronyGrammars to create the GMacCompiler front-end as a specific compiler of GMacDSL code. The GMacCompiler front-end parses and translates the GMacDSL code into the desired intermediate data structure; the <strong><a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/index.php/gmacast-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GMacAST</a></strong> structure used as the primary GA-based high-level information source for further symbolic processing at later stages. I also created mini-compilers that can translate partial GMacDSL code like a single multivector expression, a single user defined structure, or a single macro. This kind of small compilers is very useful during code composition for adding temporary structure to an already created GMacAST.</p>
<h3>Caring for the Environment, Talking to Trees</h3>
<blockquote><p>Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away. &#8212; Antoine de Saint-Exupery.</p></blockquote>
<div id="attachment_1220" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/GMacAST_MainComponents.jpeg" data-rel="lightbox-5" title=""><img class="size-medium wp-image-1220" src="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/GMacAST_MainComponents-300x268.jpeg" alt="GMacAST Main Components" width="300" height="268" srcset="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/GMacAST_MainComponents-300x268.jpeg 300w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/GMacAST_MainComponents-768x686.jpeg 768w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/GMacAST_MainComponents-1024x915.jpeg 1024w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/GMacAST_MainComponents.jpeg 1025w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">GMacAST Main Components</p></div>
<p>By 2013 I had a solid perception of the main components that GMac should have. I also was almost finished with two of GMac&#8217;s core components: GMacDSL and the GMacCompiler front-end that translated GMacDSL code into the high-level GMacAST intermediate structure. It was about time to create a proper, but simple, <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Integrated Development Environment</a> (IDE)</strong>; the <strong><a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/index.php/gmac-system-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GMacIDE</a></strong>.</p>
<p>The first thing I needed is a simple colored TextBox control for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Syntax Highlighting</a>. I soon found the nice <a href="https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/161871/Fast-Colored-TextBox-for-syntax-highlighting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FastColoredTextBox control</a> by Pavel Torgashov <sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-2531-5' id='enref-2531-5' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(2531)'>5</a></sup>. I implemented a simple interface for GMacDSL code management to handle projects containing multiple code files, to compile and report errors and warnings, explore the GMacAST, generate sample code from a single macro, and perform other functions.</p>
<p>The current GMacIDE is very simple, I hope in the future it can be extended to contain a set of Visual Editors for creating and modifying GMacDSL code and manage the details of code composition from GA-models. In addition, I need to add some form of interactive multivector visualization component to enable exploring GA-based geometry visually.</p>
<h3>Scripting Your Next Play</h3>
<blockquote><p>Talk is cheap. Show me the code. &#8212; Linus Torvalds.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/GMac.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-6" title=""><img class="alignright wp-image-2476 size-medium" src="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/GMac-300x169.jpg" alt="Script" width="300" height="169" srcset="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/GMac-300x169.jpg 300w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/GMac-768x432.jpg 768w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/GMac-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/GMac.jpg 1173w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>The GMacIDE enables the GMac user to perform many functions. One of the most important of these functions is interfacing with the <strong><a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/index.php/gmac-scripting-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GMac Scripting Engine</a></strong>. Implementing a scripting engine for a system like GMac is essential. GMacDSL is not Turing-complete, the user can describe GA-based models but can&#8217;t properly interact with them unless he uses more programming structure like loops, conditional execution, expression evaluation, etc. These functions require an interpreter, at least, to be implemented properly. In addition, the powerful symbolic processing capabilities supporting GMac can be accessed using such scripting engine.</p>
<p>GMac scripting is intended for exploration of geometric ideas through GA-based geometric models and algorithms. Three languages can be integrated into a single GMac script, each for a specific purpose:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">C# code</a> comprises the main body of the script. C# is not originally designed for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scripting purposes</a>, nevertheless, C# is a <a href="http://csharpindepth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very powerful</a> compiled statically typed object-oriented language that can be used for scripting. To simplify using C# as a scripting interface for GMac some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">syntactic sugar</a> is used to &#8220;sweeten&#8221; the process of reading and writing GMac scripts.</li>
<li><a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/index.php/gmacdsl-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GMacDSL code</a> can be executed on <a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/index.php/gmacdsl-guide/#frames" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multivector</a> values and user-defined <a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/index.php/gmacdsl-guide/#structures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">structures</a>. The scalar coefficients of multivectors can be numerical, symbolic, or a mix of both. GMac code is passed, as C# public method calls, to GMac internal services in string form to be automatically compiled and executed by the GMacCompiler.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematica" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mathematica code</a> can be executed on the Mathematica kernel used in the background by GMac. The Mathematica text code is passed through C# service method calls to the Mathematica kernel through the SymbolicInterface classes. This can be used to exploit the full power of Mathematica through GMac to perform many symbolic manipulations and graphing tasks related to the purpose of the GA-based script exploration.</li>
</ol>
<p>The main input to the script is always a GMacAST structure compiled from the main GMacDSL code. This combination of GMacAST structure, C#, GMac, and Mathematica code, make GMac scripting a very powerful method for GA-models exploration from the simple to the complex.</p>
<p>Scripting in GMac is not intended for efficient execution of GA-based algorithms. If the user is satisfied by the final algorithm, GMacAPI can be used by a good software designer to implement an efficient, well-structured version of the script in any desired programming language, with specific types of multivectors and GA algorithms.</p>
<h3>Composing Text Art</h3>
<blockquote><p>In science, if you don&#8217;t do it, somebody else will. Whereas in art, if Beethoven didn&#8217;t compose the &#8216;Ninth Symphony,&#8217; no one else before or after is going to compose the &#8216;Ninth Symphony&#8217; that he composed; no one else is going to paint &#8216;Starry Night&#8217; by van Gogh. &#8212; Neil deGrasse Tyson.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Composing-Code.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-7" title=""><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2586" src="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Composing-Code-300x200.jpg" alt="Composing Code" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Composing-Code-300x200.jpg 300w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Composing-Code.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>The final stage in any compiler is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_generation_(compiler)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">code generation</a> from some intermediate representation of the input source code. This stage is the most demanding for creativity because it relies on designing and implementing many optimizations to generate target code suitable for its specific consumer. Traditional compilers typically generate machine code for native hardware or byte code for virtual machine frameworks. This form of code is machine-oriented, cold and repetitive code not intended for reading or understanding by humans. GMac, being a DSL based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source-to-source compiler</a>, produces programmer-oriented textual source code in some high-level human-readable language. The difference between designing the code generator of any typical compiler vs. the code generator of a system like GMac is similar to the difference between designing a machine that creates mechanical parts and designing a tool-set for an artist.</p>
<p>If we look up the verb <em><strong>compose</strong></em> in the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/compose" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Merriam-Webster online dictionary</a> we&#8217;ll find the following meanings:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>A) to form by putting together</strong>: fashion; &#8216;a committee composed of three representatives&#8217;<br />
<strong>B) to form the substance of</strong>: constitute; &#8216;composed of many ingredients&#8217;<br />
<strong>C) to produce (as columns or pages of type) by composition</strong></li>
<li><strong>A) to create by mental or artistic labor</strong>: produce; &#8216;compose a sonnet&#8217;<br />
<strong>B) to formulate and write (a piece of music)</strong>: to compose music for</li>
<li><strong>to deal with or act on so as to reduce to a minimum</strong> &#8216;compose their differences&#8217;</li>
<li><strong>to arrange in proper or orderly form</strong></li>
<li><strong>to free from agitation</strong>: calm, settle &#8216;composed himself&#8217;</li>
</ol>
<p>My personal view of coding is a form of:</p>
<blockquote><p>Creative composition of highly structured, human-understandable, and machine-compilable text holding all the meanings of the verb <em><strong>compose</strong></em> stated above.</p></blockquote>
<p>To me writing code is not just about execution efficiency or blind implementation of algorithms; writing code is fundamentally artistic such that no two skilled software developers may produce the same code for a single problem. Like there can be no machine that may creatively produce music or paintings, there can be no single code generator that can, by itself, write human-understandable code with all its rich content of information, creativity, and beauty. Nevertheless, we can certainly make many smaller tool sets to help the skilled code developer layout code in the way humanly and creatively desired, while automatically generating machine-oriented code from the intermediate representation to free the <em><strong>coding artist</strong></em> from its repetitive cold nature.</p>
<p>The text generation tool set specifically created for GMac, but independently usable otherwise, is a C# library called <a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/index.php/textcomposerlib-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TextComposerLib</strong></a>. I made the decision of creating my own text generation component in 2013 after an extensive search for many similar libraries. I found no libraries that satisfied my vision for GMac. The TextComposerLib library is like a set of paint brushes to artists. The user can combine several of its text composition tools to create highly structured text. The structure can be generated on the internal level of a single document, or on the external level of files and folders.</p>
<p>In the future, I hope to make TextComposerLib more versatile and reliable by introducing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multithreading_(software)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multithreading</a> capabilities and designing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_programming" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Service-Oriented</a> interface. I also hope to release it as an open-source component for general text composition tasks.</p>
<h3>Building A Factory</h3>
<blockquote><p>Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler. &#8212; Albert Einstein.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Industrial-robots.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-8" title=""><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2528" src="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Industrial-robots-300x169.jpg" alt="Factory" width="300" height="169" srcset="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Industrial-robots-300x169.jpg 300w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Industrial-robots.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>In 2014 I began implementing the GMac part I enjoyed the most; the <strong><a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/index.php/gmacapi-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GMacAPI</a> </strong>code assembly component. If TextComposerLib is like a set of tools for artists to compose with, then GMacAPI is like a fully configurable production line for assembling structured code. Using this extensive and sophisticated <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Application Programming Interface</a> (API)</strong>, you can perform a full process of assembling code libraries in any desired target programming language. Using the GMacAPI you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supply raw materials to the assembly line; mainly a compiled GMacAST data structure that is independent of any particular target language, like C#, Python, C++, Java, etc., from any particular external computing libraries, and from any particular software architecture required.</li>
<li>Use the full composition capabilities of TextComposerLib for producing the final code.</li>
<li>Define sub-processes for assembling subsets of the final code library by inheriting from the GMacAPI core classes.</li>
<li>Monitor and log each step of the code assembly process for debugging and maintenance.</li>
<li>Use GMacDSL macros to produce a series of optimized computationally equivalent low-level code in the target language of choice.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m very proud of my work in the GMacAPI as it contains many interesting techniques from computer science and software engineering; especially techniques related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimizing_compiler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">code block optimization</a>. The tasks in which GMacAPI can be used are diverse and wide-ranging. I&#8217;ve tried my best to make it as simple as possible for a good software Engineer to use a given GA-model and create a full code library out of it. Because such goal is not easy to reach, using the GMacAPI component requires a good deal of learning and experimentation. I hope in the future to make it more accessible through some form of Visual Interface in which the software engineer can lay out the components, connect, and configure them visually with few lines of code as possible.</p>
<h3>Seeking Guidance</h3>
<blockquote><p>Conceptual integrity is the most important consideration in system design. &#8212; Fred Brooks, &#8220;The Mythical Man-Month&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/books-659690_640.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-9" title=""><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2519" src="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/books-659690_640-300x200.jpg" alt="Documentation" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/books-659690_640-300x200.jpg 300w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/books-659690_640.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Software documentation is a hard but necessary part of any software system. GMac is a sophisticated system with lots of interacting components. For a good part of 2015 and 2016, I concentrated on writing the online <strong><a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/index.php/about-gmac/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="broken_link">GMac Guides</a></strong>. The GMac Guides explain in good details the structure of the main components of GMac and how to use them as intended. While writing these guides I discovered some design deficiencies in some parts of GMac that needed fixing or enhancing. This is simply because I couldn&#8217;t explain them to myself in plain English, or with a direct example when I tried to write the GMac Guides.</p>
<p>Naturally, the full power of GMac can only be illustrated through practical examples. I&#8217;ve created the <strong><a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/index.php/gmac-samples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GMac Samples</a></strong> page on this website for this purpose. In time this page should contain enough examples that I hope would motivate users to explore the computational space using Geometric Algebra and GMac.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m writing these words on the 9th of February 2017; it is my 40th birthday. This post is my final thoughts on the 8 years journey creating my own vessel for exploration, GMac. I don&#8217;t know if I will actually get to use it, as I hope, to explore the computational universe. I still need to add a visualization component and a multivector differentiation component to the mix. I also hope I could modify the design to use other CAS like SymPy or Maple and add a Visual Interface to create GMacDSL code that should be developed to apply functional programming techniques. Many other enhancements and components are possible. Nevertheless, I have learned a lot as I initially expected. I&#8217;m now ready to explore applications and algorithms with my own tool. I&#8217;m ready to contact other people to exchange ideas and investigate possibilities. I&#8217;m ready to begin a new journey as this one ends.</p>

<blockquote><p>The belief that complex systems require armies of designers and programmers is wrong. A system that is not understood in its entirety, or at least to a significant degree of detail by a single individual, should probably not be built. &#8212; Niklaus Wirth.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the summer of 2003, I was almost at the end of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06973" target="_blank">my M.Sc. thesis</a>. One day I was surfing the web searching for some references to add to the thesis I&#8217;d been writing. I ran into Mikael Nilsson’s interesting <a href="http://cid.nada.kth.se/pdf/CID-201.pdf" target="_blank">M.Sc. thesis</a> “Geometric Algebra with Conzilla: Building a Conceptual Web of Mathematics”. His work contains a nice introduction to Geometric Algebra, with accompanying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language" target="_blank">UML</a>-based conceptual models. It got me very curious about GA. I made some more searches finding a few papers, books, and tutorials. After reading some of them I was suddenly transferred into a new world of algebraic abstractions. For the first time in my life as a student, engineer, and software developer I could hope to express, explore, and manipulate geometric abstractions with such clarity. I then decided that my Ph.D. will be about exploring Geometric Algebra using the best way I know: developing software. It was a natural decision to make given GA&#8217;s potential, but a hard and lonely journey to make. About 8 years have passed now developing my tool, <strong><a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/index.php/about-gmac/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">GMac</a></strong>, into its current state all by myself passing through difficult events I could only have passed by Allah&#8217;s well and mercy.</p>
<p>In this post and the next, I talk about this journey and some of the lessons I learned along the way. I talk about how the current GMac design came to appear and the joys I found learning the hard way that profound belief <sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-2532-1' id='enref-2532-1' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(2532)'>1</a></sup>, solid foundation, clear goals, and lots of patience are together the only way to realizing distant dreams.</p>
<h3>Discovering The Computational Universe</h3>
<blockquote><p>I had a very selfish reason for building Mathematica. I wanted to use it myself, a bit like Galileo got to use his telescope four hundred years ago. But I wanted to look, not at the astronomical universe, but at the computational universe. &#8212; Stephen Wolfram.</p></blockquote>
<div id="attachment_2486" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Rule30-first-500-rows.png" data-rel="lightbox-1" title=""><img class="size-medium wp-image-2486" src="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Rule30-first-500-rows-300x150.png" alt="Rule30-first-500-rows" width="300" height="150" srcset="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Rule30-first-500-rows-300x150.png 300w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Rule30-first-500-rows-768x384.png 768w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Rule30-first-500-rows.png 1008w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Rule 30: Rich behavior can emerge from very simple computational rules. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_30" target="_blank">source</a>)</p></div>
<p>In the Autumn of 2005, I&#8217;d just begun my Ph.D. preparatory courses when I had another perceptual shift, this time in how I think about computations. I found Stephen Wolfram&#8217;s 2002 fascinating book <strong>&#8220;<a href="http://www.wolframscience.com/thebook.html" target="_blank">A New Kind of Science</a>&#8221; (NKS)</strong> after watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eC14GonZnU&amp;t=2s" data-rel="lightbox-video-0" target="_blank">one of his lectures about it</a>. After reading a few pages of NKS online, I couldn&#8217;t stop until I finished reading the whole book, without the endnotes, in just 2 weeks. I couldn&#8217;t wait to buy the book because it would take at least a month to arrive back then so <a href="http://www.wolframscience.com/nks/" target="_blank">I read it online</a>.</p>
<p>Reading this book made me rethink about many concepts of science, mathematics, and computation that I took for granted. Concepts like <a href="http://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-4--systems-based-on-numbers/" target="_blank">numbers</a>, <a href="http://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-6--starting-from-randomness/" target="_blank">chaos</a>, <a href="http://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-6--starting-from-randomness/" target="_blank">randomness</a>, <a href="http://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-3--the-world-of-simple-programs/" target="_blank">complexity</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ0WG3D3m1U" data-rel="lightbox-video-1" target="_blank">intelligence</a>, <a href="http://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p606--traditional-mathematics-and-mathematical-formulas/" target="_blank">mathematical models</a>, and <a href="http://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-11--the-notion-of-computation/" target="_blank">the nature of computation</a>. Although I don&#8217;t agree with everything he says in his book, Wolfram&#8217;s insights and explorations are fascinating and inspiring for someone like me. The most intriguing of all the concepts he talks about is the <strong><a href="http://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/mining-computational-universe/" target="_blank">Computational Universe</a></strong>. Wolfram used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton" target="_blank">cellular automata</a> and similar computational tools for mapping and mining the computational universe.</p>
<p>I instantly realized that Geometric Algebra can be a uniquely valuable tool in any attempt to explore the computational universe. I just needed the right computational vessel to make such explorations. I searched a lot but found none that suited my goals. I read that Wolfram had created <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram_Mathematica" target="_blank"><strong>Mathematica</strong></a> as his personal lab for doing computational experiments. All this made me decide to create my own GA-based tool for voyaging and exploring the computational universe, and so my journey began.</p>
<h3>Creating The Perfect Library</h3>
<blockquote><p>Good judgment comes from experience, and experience comes from bad judgment. &#8212; Frederick P. Brooks</p></blockquote>
<div id="attachment_2487" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/OOPrinciples.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-2" title=""><img class="size-medium wp-image-2487" src="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/OOPrinciples-300x266.jpg" alt="OO Design Principles" width="300" height="266" srcset="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/OOPrinciples-300x266.jpg 300w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/OOPrinciples.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Object Oriented Design Principles (<a href="https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/186107/Object-Orientation-Beginners-Tutorial" target="_blank">source</a>)</p></div>
<p>When it comes to repetitive tasks, good software developers are the laziest of people; they prefer to create programs to do the repetitive tasks for them <sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-2532-2' id='enref-2532-2' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(2532)'>2</a></sup>. To be more accurate, their deep creativity drives their apparent laziness. They never want to do the same task twice, and if they have to, they never want to do it in the same way. They almost always enjoy finding the most general framework for doing several tasks at once with minimum effort; I&#8217;m one of those people.</p>
<p>I started my actual Ph.D. research work in 2007 by studying GA mathematics through reading the excellent book &#8220;<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780123694652" target="_blank">Geometric Algebra for Computer Science</a>&#8220;. In 2008 I started to investigate several software designs and implementations in hope to implement a single perfect universal GA-based software library.</p>
<p>Driven by my creative laziness, I initially thought that the powerful unification GA brings to mathematics can be directly translated into a unified software library suitable for all <a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/index.php/2015/09/18/ga-computing2/" target="_blank">Geometric Computing</a> purposes. I was naive back then with little experience in the difficult problems that face designing large sophisticated multi-purpose software systems. I gradually realized that this perfect software library is a myth. While working on the development of two big decision support software systems based on relational databases for several years, I gradually gained experience in the true meaning of the phrase &#8220;Necessity is the Mother of Invention&#8221;.</p>
<p>Successful software libraries are mainly driven by necessity not only by the elegance of some underlying abstraction, even a beautiful algebraic abstraction such as GA. Each particular application has its own set of necessities that we, software engineers, call requirements: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_requirement" target="_blank">functional</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement" target="_blank">non-functional</a>, financial, scope related, performance related, etc. There can never be a single perfect software library suitable for all applications in a wide-ranging domain like Geometric Computing.</p>
<p>Failing in my initial attempt I went higher in the level of abstraction. I had a good background in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_design" target="_blank">Object-Oriented (OO) Software Design</a>. Why not, I asked myself, create an OO design based on the mathematical concepts of Geometric Algebra and then derive specific concrete implementations for specific applications. After all, this is how I learned about GA originally; using UML to diagram GA&#8217;s main concepts and relations. I soon found that OO design is a good conceptual tool to study some domain, but there can never be a single OO design suitable for all purposes either; especially when good memory\processing performance is critical <sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-2532-3' id='enref-2532-3' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(2532)'>3</a></sup>. This got me to learn about other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm" target="_blank">programming paradigms</a> I&#8217;ve never considered reading about before.</p>
<h3>Shifting Paradigms</h3>
<blockquote><p>One principle problem of educating software engineers is that they will not use a new method until they believe it works and, more importantly, that they will not believe the method will work until they see it for themselves. &#8212; W. S. Humphrey, The Personal Software Process</p></blockquote>
<div id="attachment_2480" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Programming-Paradigms.png" data-rel="lightbox-3" title=""><img class="size-medium wp-image-2480" src="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Programming-Paradigms-300x261.png" alt="Programming Paradigms" width="300" height="261" srcset="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Programming-Paradigms-300x261.png 300w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Programming-Paradigms-768x667.png 768w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Programming-Paradigms-1024x889.png 1024w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Programming-Paradigms.png 1179w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Programming Paradigms (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Programming_paradigms.svg" target="_blank">source</a>)</p></div>
<p>Back in 2009, I only knew about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming" target="_blank">procedural programming</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming" target="_blank">object oriented programming</a>. I did some reading and discovered many other paradigms like functional, aspect-oriented, concurrent, dynamic, feature-oriented, and more. I realized that GA can be used equally well as an algebraic base for creating software in all of these paradigms. My deep creative laziness led me to the most general of all paradigms: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_programming" target="_blank">Automatic Meta-Programming</a>.</p>
<p>In April 2009 I bought and read the book &#8220;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Generative-Programming-Methods-Tools-Applications/dp/0201309777" target="_blank">Generative Programming: Methods, Tools, and Applications</a>&#8221; in which the authors present a grand tour of <a href="http://program-transformation.org/Transform/GenerativeProgrammingWiki" target="_blank">Generative Programming</a> that is bound to become a classic. The book focuses on the generally unappreciated connection, back then, between <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language" target="_blank">Domain Specific Languages</a> (DSLs)</strong> and Generative Programming as a motivation for future developments. I immediately started designing and implementing the first prototype of my dream GA-based software vessel for exploring the computational universe; I called it GMac. The prototype took a couple of months to be functional for the purpose of completing my Ph.D. <sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-2532-4' id='enref-2532-4' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(2532)'>4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I tried to apply some of what I&#8217;d learned from the Generative Programming book to implement simple GA-based algorithms, which I call <em><strong>G</strong></em>eometric <em><strong>Mac</strong></em>ros, through code generation. A geometric macro is a set of standard GA multivector expressions assigned to local variables inside the macro. There are no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow" target="_blank">control flow statements</a> inside this simple computational concept. All the computational power mainly comes from the mathematics of GA itself. I used the GMac prototype to implement parts of a ray tracer that I implemented based on Kevin Suffern&#8217;s nice book &#8220;<a href="http://www.raytracegroundup.com/" target="_blank">Ray Tracing from the Ground Up</a>&#8220;, in addition to some other small computational problems.</p>
<p>Using Automatic Programming and Code Generation is a fundamental design decision I made for GMac. My experience with OO design can be expected to extend to all other programming paradigms. There can be no universal design methodology suitable for all applications. Even more, in a single large application, we might need several paradigms to be used <sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-2532-5' id='enref-2532-5' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(2532)'>5</a></sup>. The only common activity between all paradigms is the creative composition of structured textual code that is both human-readable and machine-compilable. Instead of trying to force some kind of fixed design method upon GA-based application developers, we can just provide a set of powerful tools to help them in composing their application in whatever programming paradigm, software system design, or programming language they choose. I still believe this is the best, most effective, and most general way to use GA in software development.</p>

The brains of Introverts and Extroverts work differently.</p></div>
<p>My Ph.D. part of the journey was completed in April 2010 when I defended my thesis. It was an exhausting part of my life with many difficulties resulting from working in an anti-scientific, anti-creative environment by design; especially for <a href="https://www.quietrev.com/6-illustrations-that-show-what-its-like-in-an-introverts-head/" target="_blank">introverted people</a> like me <sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-2532-7' id='enref-2532-7' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(2532)'>7</a></sup>. In this difficult environment, I met many talented, highly creative, and mostly self-educated people. These people motivated their colleagues and students to make the best research possible and sincerely promoted good education. I&#8217;m very grateful for their presence in my life. The system itself is designed to kill the hope in such talented people or drive them out into more scientifically and humanly attractive environments <sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-2532-8' id='enref-2532-8' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(2532)'>8</a></sup>. As Barry Schwartz <sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-2532-9' id='enref-2532-9' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(2532)'>9</a></sup> describes it in <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_the_way_we_think_about_work_is_broken?language=en" target="_blank">his beautiful TED talk</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is not true that you &#8220;just can&#8217;t get good help anymore.&#8221; It is true that you &#8220;can&#8217;t get good help anymore&#8221; when you give people work to do that is demeaning and soulless. And interestingly enough, Adam Smith — the same guy who gave us this incredible invention of mass production, and division of labor — understood this. He said, of people who worked in assembly lines, of men who worked in assembly lines, he says: &#8220;He generally becomes as stupid as it is possible for a human being to become.&#8221; Now, notice the word here is &#8220;become.&#8221; &#8220;He generally becomes as stupid as it is possible for a human being to become.&#8221; Whether he intended it or not, what Adam Smith was telling us there, is that the very shape of the institution within which people work creates people who are fitted to the demands of that institution and deprives people of the opportunity to derive the kinds of satisfactions from their work that we take for granted.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can get some idea about the results of this sad situation by reading this 2011 article by Hillel Ofek: &#8220;<a href="http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/why-the-arabic-world-turned-away-from-science" target="_blank">Why the Arabic World Turned Away From Science</a>&#8220;. I can only pray and hope this situation changes in the near future.</p>
<p>In 2010 I made a mistake trying to publish my Ph.D. work as an article in a high-profile journal not concerned about Geometric Algebra. They rejected the article for good reasons, mostly not related to GA but to the article itself. The editor gave me a piece of advice going around Geometric Algebra having nothing new to offer in terms of applications in computer science. He emphasized that more effort must be made by the GA community to overcome this situation by finding new insights that only GA can provide. I realized then that choosing to do research using GA is a lonely path to take. Recently, I made some <a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/index.php/category/interview/" target="_blank">interviews</a> with leading researchers in the GA community who stated this experience in similar words. The situation has gotten much better in the last couple of years where GA-related research started to appear at increasing rates in many fields in engineering and computer science.</p>
<p>After completing my Ph.D. back in 2010 I knew I had to design a new version of GMac to realize my dream vessel for exploring the computational universe with Geometric Algebra. I knew it would be a difficult journey to make. As Walter Bright puts it in his article &#8220;<a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/so-you-want-to-write-your-own-language/240165488" target="_blank">So You Want To Write Your Own Language?</a>&#8220;:</p>
<blockquote><p>First off, you&#8217;re in for a lot of work…years of work…most of which will be wandering in the desert. The odds of success are heavily stacked against you. If you are not strongly self-motivated to do this, it isn&#8217;t going to happen. If you need validation and encouragement from others, it isn&#8217;t going to happen.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, I was certain that GA will be accepted in the near future as a major language for mathematical modeling in computer science and engineering. I was also certain that I will gain much experience and feel many joys developing the next generation of GMac. I could only work on my project alone against the surrounding environment for two to four months per year because of my many family obligations and non-research work duties. These available months weren&#8217;t even consecutive; they were spread along the year with no apparent order. During all these years whenever I got an opportunity to make research I faced a difficult question. Should I focus on writing papers in computer science topics not related to Geometric Algebra to be promoted? Or should I invest the little time I had in developing my dream vessel? I always chose the second.</p>
<p>After I finally got promoted to Assistant Professor <sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-2532-10' id='enref-2532-10' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(2532)'>10</a></sup> in July 2010 and for another full year up to Summer 2011, I had to find additional jobs to support my family, so I had to delay developing the next generation of GMac until August 2011.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/index.php/2017/02/10/gmac-tng-2/" target="_blank">the final part</a> of this series, I will talk about the next phase of my journey developing GMac&#8217;s next generation. I will explain its main components and how I arrived at their design.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>ne of the most important fields of application for Geometric algebra can be found in Computer Science. In this post, I interview 3 key researchers who apply Geometric Algebra in their work to share their valuable experience and insights. Their applied research spans many applications in computer science including Computer Graphics, Robotics, Computer Vision, Image Processing, Neural Computing, and more.</p>

<h3><strong>Dr. Leo Dorst</strong></h3>
<p><span style="color: #003366;"><strong><a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dr.-Leo-Dorst.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-1" title=""><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2355" src="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dr.-Leo-Dorst.jpg" alt="Dr. Leo Dorst" width="200" height="200" srcset="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dr.-Leo-Dorst.jpg 200w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dr.-Leo-Dorst-150x150.jpg 150w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dr.-Leo-Dorst-160x160.jpg 160w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dr.-Leo-Dorst-320x320.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a>Tell us about your primary research and teaching interests. What sort of satisfaction do you get when working on your primary interests?</strong></span></p>
<p>My primary interest is the interplay between geometry and its algebraic representation. It is great fun to derive some equation solving a problem, and then hearing it begin to talk to you about aspects you had never considered in the original formulation. This works most strongly in GA, which is why I love that framework. However, it is hard to find funding for this in abstracto. I am currently tying it into a project on restoring broken archaeological artifacts based on 3D scans (project-gravitate.eu); in a theoretical work package, this pulls in my earlier work on geometric path planning and mathematical morphology and offers an opportunity to study finite elements methods from a GA point of view.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #003366;">What do you think are the main characteristics of GA as a mathematical modeling language?</span></strong></p>
<p>GA clears your mind and your software, even when you decide to stick to LA in practice (at least, in the beginning). The disgusting number of different terms and techniques in LA which are all, in hindsight, ways to avoid using the outer product are a good example. Once you realize that outer product exists, much of the operations described in natural language (like &#8216;span&#8217;) coherently collapse to elementary and compact algebraic operations under your own control. Certainly, in computer science where 3D is just not enough (the spaces involved in machine learning are very high-dimensional), the outer product MUST be taught. And once you have the outer product, you might as well absorb the geometric product for generalized projections and rejections. As for operators, use rotors instead of quaternions, so you have something that is real and that generalizes to n-D.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Tell us about your important book, coauthored with S. Mann and D. Fontijne, &#8220;Geometric Algebra for Computer Science&#8221; (GA4CS). How can the GA community make more books like it to help attract more people to learn and apply GA in their research and teaching?</strong></span></p>
<p>After I just learned GA, I was amazed by the clarity it provides at the computational basis for geometry, and its new elements and operators at an intermediate level of abstraction: it is great to have the very interesting new primitives, especially in CGA (conformal geometric algebra). What can we do more or better once we learn to think in terms of those primitives? I knew I could not develop the consequences for intermediate and high-level algorithms myself &#8212; there is just too much reform to do, in too many fields. So we wrote a book to convey the basic tools and the algebraically supported intuition of their interplay, for others to do that work, each in their own subfield. It has not quite taken off yet in the way I hoped, though there are some examples (such as work by Ishida at Honda on genetic algorithms for road-following using GA primitives and their interactions as the chromosomes and cross-over operations). We need more work at that intermediate level, showing how or when the possibility not to go down to the vector level pays off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>If you were to write a second book on GA mathematics and applications after 10 years of GA4CS, what new GA topics would you include? What new applications?</strong></span></p>
<p>At some point it would be good to collate some convincing applications of the new thinking, directly employing the intermediate primitives (like the Honda example above, or the application to GIS). Our 2011 &#8216;Guide to GA in Practice&#8217; contains some good chapters in those directions, but a proper book would need more tight editorial coherence. I would like to see parts on projective geometric algebra since that is so important to graphics (I believe R(3,3) is the right model, but we still need to learn to encode the world in its primitives, the line complexes), and on finite element methods done in GA (with special emphasis on 3D meshes).</p>

<h3>Dr. Dietmar Hildenbrand</h3>
<p><span style="color: #003366;"><strong><a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dr.-Dietmar-Hildenbrand.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-2" title=""><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2356" src="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dr.-Dietmar-Hildenbrand-297x300.jpg" alt="Dr. Dietmar Hildenbrand" width="297" height="300" srcset="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dr.-Dietmar-Hildenbrand-297x300.jpg 297w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dr.-Dietmar-Hildenbrand.jpg 564w" sizes="(max-width: 297px) 100vw, 297px" /></a>What reasons made you want to do research related to Geometric Algebra? Tell us about the difficulties you faced </strong><strong>and the satisfactions you felt during your journey with GA until now.</strong></span></p>
<p>When I started to work with GA in 2003, I was immediately very impressed how easy it is to develop 3D algorithms dealing with geometric objects and operations based on GA. I was very happy to use a tool providing me an immediate visual result for mathematical expressions: CLUCalc from Christian Perwass. I am still developing most of my GA algorithms with CLUCalc and, in my opinion, CLUCalc is still today the best tool in order to learn how to use Geometric Algebra for 3D applications.</p>
<p>In 2004, when I organized and presented a GA tutorial at the Eurographics conference in Grenoble together with Christian Perwass, Daniel Fontijne, and Leo Dorst, the feedback was positive and negative at the same time.<br />
On one hand, many people were happy about the expressiveness of GA, but on the other hand, it was clear for everybody that implementations of computer graphics applications were not competitive in terms of runtime performance.</p>
<p>I realized that improving the runtime performance of GA will be the key to convincing engineers to use GA in their applications. At that time, nobody really expected that it could be possible for implementations of GA algorithms to be faster than the conventional implementation. But, in 2006, we were happy to present even two different implementations proving exactly that for a computer animation application (the movement of the arm of a virtual character).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Tell us about Geometric Algebra Computing (GAC). What were your initial expectations when you started working </strong></span><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>on that topic? What is its current state? How do you see the future of GAC and its applications in computer science </strong></span><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>and engineering?</strong></span></p>
<p>Our approach for the just mentioned proof-of-concept application was very specific. This is why our next goal was a general system making it possible for almost every engineer to include GA in his/her application. And, the description of GA algorithms should be as much as possible similar to how CLUCalc ist doing that.</p>
<p>Now, we are happy to provide the Gaalop (Geometric Algebra Algorithms Optimizer) precompiler for the integration of GA into standard programming languages such as C++, OpenCL, CUDA and C++ AMP.</p>
<p>The integration is done based on GaalopScript, which is very much inspired by the CLUCalc scripting language. This technology is described in my book &#8220;Foundations of Geometric Algebra Computing&#8221; from 2013. Since 2015 this technology is part of the ecosystem of the HSA Foundation of more than 40 companies dealing with new heterogeneous computing architectures. Now, we have this technology available, as well as some other GA tools such as GMac, Gaigen, Gaalet and Versor, but the community working with it is still very small. The future of GAC and its applications in computer science and engineering relies heavily on whether we will succeed in closing this gap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>What steps do you think should the GA community take to gain wider spread of GA among the larger community of engineers and computer scientists?</strong></span></p>
<p>Today, we indeed have this GAC technology available for easy to develop, geometrically intuitive, robust and fast engineering applications, but there is still only a small number of people knowing it. Exactly at this point, the book &#8220;Introduction to Geometric Algebra Computing&#8221;, that I am just writing, comes into place. The main goal of this book is to close the gap with an introduction of GA from an engineering/computing perspective. The intended audiences are students, engineers, and researchers interested in learning GAC. This book is intended to give a rapid introduction to the computing with Geometric Algebra and its power for geometric modeling. From the geometric objects point of view, it focuses on the most basic ones, namely points, lines, and circles. We call this algebra Compass Ruler Algebra since you are able to handle it comparable to working with compass and ruler. It offers the possibility to compute with these geometric objects and their geometric operations and transformations in a very intuitive way. While focusing on 2D it is easily expandable to 3D computations as used in many books dealing with the very popular Conformal Geometric Algebra in engineering applications such as computer graphics, computer vision, and robotics. This book follows a top-down approach. Focusing first on how to use GA, it is up to the reader how much he/she would like to go into the details.</p>
<p>Another attempt to gain wider spread is the ENGAGE (Empowering Novel Geometric Algebra for Graphics &amp; Engineering) workshop as part of the CGI (Computer Graphics International) conference. This year, this will be in Japan (<a href="http://fj.ics.keio.ac.jp/cgi17/" target="_blank">http://fj.ics.keio.ac.jp/cgi17/</a>). But, sure, there is still the need of many good ideas in order to attract more and more engineers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>I know you are interested in teaching GA in schools. From your point of view, what steps are required in the near future to reach a wide acceptance of this idea? What are the difficulties you see facing its achievement?</strong></span></p>
<p>Yes, you are right, I already have some experience with GA at schools. Because of its geometric intuitiveness, it is very easy for children to develop algorithms in GA. In some workshops, I could see that children are happy to solve simple robotics problems which they normally are not able to before university. A colleague of mine already taught special relativity based on GA at school. But the main problem is to make GA really part of the curriculum. Maybe some teachers/responsibles for curricula will use my above mentioned new book for teaching themselves and for introducing it already in school.</p>

<h3><strong>Dr. Eckhard Hitzer</strong></h3>
<p><span style="color: #003366;"><strong><a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dr.-Eckhard-Hitzer.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-3" title=""><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2357" src="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dr.-Eckhard-Hitzer.jpg" alt="Dr. Eckhard Hitzer" width="200" height="160" /></a>During the previous years, you&#8217;ve been following the developments in applied GA through your GA Updates blog. How do you see the current state of GA research? In what application areas do you expect the next developments will probably be?</strong></span></p>
<p>Geometric Algebra research is not only revolutionizing algorithm development in many fields (robotics, visualization, mapping, virtual reality, GIS, molecular dynamics, telecommunication, offshore mechatronics, 3D cadastres, navigation, &#8230;), it also begins to exhibit superior accuracy, stability, and speed, and is increasingly introduced in mainstream computing ecosystems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>What types of problems, from your experience, can be handled with GA more effectively relative to classical techniques in neural computing and signal processing? What kinds of ideas can be investigated in these two areas using GA&#8217;s powerful mathematics?</strong></span></p>
<p>In neural computing and signal processing Geometric Algebra allows to generalize 1D and 2D algorithms seamlessly to higher dimensions with great advantages for electromagnetic signals, including light and color, and it fully captures, analyzes and reproduces complex high dimensional geometric relationships and topology. It begins to be used for technologies needed for autonomous driving, color face recognition, land mine detection, speech recognition, new forms of tomography, &#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>If you are talking to a new post-graduate student and trying to explain the benefits of using GA in his future research activities, what would you tell him about GA? What pitfalls would you warn him not to get into? What expectations should he have related to the future of GA research?</strong></span></p>
<p>Be ready to unlearn often inefficient, inaccurate, unintuitive matrix methods and systems of linear equations. Instead learn to think and work directly in terms of geometric entities, their relations, transformations, and interactions, all efficiently and invariantly expressed directly by geometric algebra entities and their products. Resist the initial temptation to fall back into coordinate system component techniques, which hide geometric realities behind veils of stupendous numerical arrays. Expect to liberate your geometric intuition, and be able to work with an advanced single universal integrative mathematical system for whatever problem or task you may face in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>How can the GA community gain more supporters and members in the near future? What kinds of events, funding proposals, online activities, etc. should the GA community focus on to attain this goal?</strong></span></p>
<p>Organizing sessions and workshops at major science and engineering conferences is a good way. International collaborative projects might be another. Submitting research papers to all types of science and engineering journals, when the applications topic permits that, rather than highly specialized journals. Preprints published ASAP on servers like vixra.org, preprint.org, etc. and open access, will also help. In addition, sharing lectures and software demos on YouTube will help interested students, professionals, and engineers to know about geometric algebra even outside formal educational and academic workshop settings.</p>
