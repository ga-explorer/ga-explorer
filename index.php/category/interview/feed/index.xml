<p><a href="http://faculty.luther.edu/~macdonal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Alan Macdonald</a> is Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at Luther College in Decorah Iowa. He received a Ph.D. in mathematics from The University of Michigan in 1970. His research interests include geometric algebra and the foundations of physics.</p>
<p>Dr. Alan is the author of two excellent books that introduce Geometric Algebra and Geometric Calculus to undergraduate students. In his first book <a href="http://faculty.luther.edu/~macdonal/laga/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Linear and Geometric Algebra</strong></em></a>, he develops the first undergraduate text to cover the essentials of linear algebra and its extension to geometric algebra. Prof. David Hestenes commented on his first book saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>I commend Alan Macdonald for his excellent book! His exposition is clean and spare. He has done a fine job of engineering a gradual transition from standard views of linear algebra to the perspective of geometric algebra. The book is sufficiently conventional to be adopted as a textbook by an adventurous teacher without getting flack from colleagues. Yet it leads to gems of geometric algebra that are likely to delight thoughtful students and surprise even the most experienced instructors.</p></blockquote>
<p>His second book <a href="http://faculty.luther.edu/~macdonal/vagc/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Vector and Geometric Calculus</strong></em></a> distinguishes itself from similar books on advanced calculus by two attributes: its thoroughgoing use of Geometric Algebra and the clarity of its exposition at an undergraduate level.</p>

<p>I read strong claims about geometric algebra and decided to look for myself. I was smitten. I found that geometric algebra and its extension to geometric calculus unify, simplify, and generalize vast areas of mathematics involving geometric ideas, including linear algebra, vector calculus, complex analysis, exterior algebra and calculus, tensor algebra and calculus, quaternions (3D spinors), and euclidean, non-euclidean, and projective geometries. I also found that GA provides a common mathematical language for many areas of physics (classical and quantum mechanics, electrodynamics, special and general relativity), computer science (graphics, robotics, computer vision), engineering, and other fields. People in disparate fields can now talk to each other!</p>

How do you respond to this kind of question?</div><div class="su-service-content su-clearfix" style="padding-left:46px">
<p>My response: <em><strong>Geometric algebra unifies many of your mathematical tools and works better than any of them</strong>.</em> Unfortunately, this has not been sufficient to induce many to switch. GA takes time to learn. And once learned, there is the problem of communicating with others who haven&#8217;t learned. Nevertheless, geometric algebra is gaining adherents, slowly but surely.</p>

<p>Geometric algebra is a superset of linear algebra, with more objects, multivectors, and more operations; for example, the geometric product. So anything that linear algebra can do geometric algebra can do. Even within linear algebra, geometric algebra brings advantages. Here is a simple example. Consider the orthogonal complement of a subspace: the set of vectors orthogonal to all vectors in the subspace. For both linear and geometric algebra this <strong><em>geometric</em> </strong>definition tells us what the orthogonal complement <strong><em>is</em></strong>. Geometric algebra adds algebra, providing a very simple way to <strong><em>compute</em> </strong>the complement (as a dual), something linear algebra can&#8217;t do. This illustrates the name <em><strong>Geometric Algebra</strong></em>: it does geometry algebraically.</p>

<p>I share David Hestenes&#8217; vision of wide acceptance of GA and the advantages this will bring.</p>
<p>A vital aspect of making this happen is encouraging and enabling GA&#8217;s inclusion in the undergraduate mathematics curriculum. The only way that mathematics faculties will consider this is to have available GA texts written in traditional mathematics textbook style. This is my small contribution to Hestenes&#8217; vision.</p>
<p>Mathematicians have been infuriatingly slow in becoming interested in geometric algebra. We are repeating the short-sightedness of 120 years ago when <em><strong>Engineers welcomed Gibbs&#8217;s and Heaviside&#8217;s vector analysis, though the mathematicians did not</strong> </em><sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-2731-1' id='enref-2731-1' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(2731)'>1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I chose <a href="http://docs.sympy.org/0.7.0/modules/galgebra/GA/GAsympy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alan Bromborsky&#8217;s GAlgebra</a> for my texts because it is free, it is multiplatform, it does <strong><em>symbolic</em> </strong>calculations, and it is well designed. But it is far from everything I could ask for: its syntax for expressions is sometimes awkward; it requires several other programs, e.g., Python, making installation difficult for some; and it has no graphics capability.</p>
<p>I would like to see a program with GAlgebra&#8217;s strengths but not its shortcomings.</p>

<p>My experience is in teaching undergraduate mathematics in the United States, so I will speak to that. Students typically take a year of scalar calculus in their first year of college, then courses in linear algebra and vector calculus in their second year.</p>
<p>The most natural place to introduce GA &amp; GC is right after scalar calculus. I believe that the current second-year linear algebra and vector calculus courses should be renamed <em>Geometric Algebra</em> and <em>Geometric Calculus</em>, their purpose being to provide the basic vocabulary of mathematics in dimensions greater than one. By judiciously trimming the current courses and taking advantage of the simplifications of GA &amp; GC, a lot of GA &amp; GC can be covered. My two textbooks <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Geometric-Algebra-Alan-Macdonald/dp/1453854932" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Linear and Geometric Algebra</em></a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Geometric-Calculus-Alan-Macdonald/dp/1480132454/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=1480132454&amp;pd_rd_r=YMSWSBWDXT255WXMRTN6&amp;pd_rd_w=PZx9C&amp;pd_rd_wg=p6xhV&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=YMSWSBWDXT255WXMRTN6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Vector and Geometric Calculus</em></a> are attempts at this.</p>

<p>GA &amp; GC are well developed at the elementary level, ready for use. But there are problems to be solved before they can take their rightful place.</p>
<p>We face a chicken and egg problem: students must learn GA &amp; GC to apply them, and those applying vector methods, but not brought up on GA &amp; GC, must push for their inclusion in the curriculum. And if students learn GA &amp; GC in their second year, this cannot be a dead end: instructors in later courses must use them in their courses. Another problem: people are reluctant to publish using a mathematical formalism unknown to most. We can only do our best, making incremental progress until a critical mass is achieved.</p>

<span class="dropcap">P</span><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rojective Geometry</a></strong> is the branch of geometry dealing with the properties and invariants of geometric figures under projection. In older literature, projective geometry is sometimes called &#8220;higher geometry,&#8221; &#8220;geometry of position,&#8221; or &#8220;descriptive geometry&#8221;. The most amazing result arising in projective geometry is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duality_(projective_geometry)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>duality principle</strong></a>, which states that a duality exists between theorems such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's_theorem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pascal&#8217;s theorem</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brianchon%27s_theorem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brianchon&#8217;s theorem</a> which allows one to be instantly transformed into the other. More generally, all the propositions in projective geometry occur in dual pairs, which have the property that, starting from either proposition of a pair, the other can be immediately inferred by interchanging the parts played by the words &#8220;point&#8221; and &#8220;line.&#8221;</p>

Why do you focus on this particular area? Do you have specific PGA-related long-term goals?</div><div class="su-service-content su-clearfix" style="padding-left:46px">
<p>My interest in PGA is a natural outgrowth of my long-standing interest in projective geometry. One of the phases in this process was my work at the <a href="http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/">Geometry Center</a> at the University of Minnesota (1987-1993), where we created interactive visualizations of hyperbolic and spherical space for the first time using the projective models of these spaces, under the guidance of the late Bill Thurston.</p>
<p>It was natural then that when I went back (quite a bit later) to get a Ph. D. I looked into how not just to make pictures but how to do physics in these non-euclidean spaces. That&#8217;s when I became aware of a certain family of geometric algebras that I have since christened PGA and that formed the technical foundation for <a href="http://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~gunn/Documents/Papers/Thesis-final.pdf">my thesis</a> (Technical University Berlin, 2011).</p>
<p>The non-euclidean cases were already familiar to the pioneers of GA in the 1870&#8217;s such as Clifford and Klein; the euclidean case, however, is a bit tricky and was first enunciated by Jon Selig in around 2000. I have gone on to explore PGA more thoroughly and have published a series of articles devoted especially to the euclidean case; since I think it&#8217;s a fantastic tool &#8212; both conceptually and practically &#8212; for doing euclidean geometry. It includes as sub-algebras the well-known vector, quaternion, and dual (or bi-) quaternion algebras, but offers much more besides. It deserves to be much better-known than it is, especially in the applied mathematics and engineering community. In the article &#8220;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.6502">Geometric algebras for euclidean geometry</a>&#8221; I have shown that for classical &#8220;flat&#8221; euclidean geometry, PGA exhibits distinct advantages over the alternative approaches. It serves also as an ideal stepping-stone both scientifically and pedagogically to more complex GAs such as CGA. This article and others can be accessed at my <a href="http://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~gunn/PGA/">PGA resource page</a>.</p>

<p>The development of mathematics in the 19th century was unique: radical advances were made in every field but an underlying unity was preserved so that leading mathematicians still had an overview of the whole. The transition to the 20th century saw an increasing specialization, the cost was a splintering of the whole. Decisions were made that in retrospect appear to have been motivated more by an ideology of abstraction than by a balanced practical judgment. PGA I think has the potential to stand as &#8220;living proof&#8221; that 19th-century mathematics still has much to offer to the contemporary community of applied geometry. It unifies two of William Clifford&#8217;s greatest inventions: biquaternions and geometric algebra, in the simplest, most elegant way imaginable, and provides an unsurpassed framework for doing kinematics and rigid body mechanics in euclidean (or non-euclidean) space.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it&#8217;s also important to note that PGA also contains seeds for the future. I&#8217;m particularly interested in this regard in dual euclidean space, which is a metric geometry obtained from euclidean geometry by dualizing it. It arises naturally as a variant of PGA. It was described by Felix Klein in the 19th century but was so unfamiliar that is was relegated to being a curiosity. There is an increasing volume of research, however, indicating that it might play an important role in future science by balancing a certain one-sidedness in our contemporary spatial awareness. Ch. 10 of my thesis contains an introduction to this fascinating theme, available on the resource site above.</p>
<p>The prospect of using PGA in this way to better understand Nature also resonates with the 19th-century heritage.  The great pioneers of that era &#8212; Möbius, Plücker, Riemann, Grassmann, Clifford, and Klein, among others &#8212; were all inspired, in their mathematical research, by physical questions. I personally think that mathematics needs such real-world connections in order to develop healthily and am curious to see whether PGA can help to strengthen such connections.</p>

<p>I am no expert on <a href="http://www.cut-the-knot.org/pythagoras/RationalTrig/CutTheKnot.shtml">Wildberger&#8217;s Rational Trigonometry</a>, although I find the basic idea intriguing. One avoids the messiness of evaluating irrational and/or transcendental functions by working with the sine/cosine of the angle rather than with the angle itself, the square of the norm of a vector instead of the norm, etc. A friend loaned me a copy of Wildberger&#8217;s book as I was finishing my thesis and I made it a project to see how many of his results I could rephrase in the language of PGA. I was surprised myself by how well this process went. For example, the fundamental concepts of rational trigonometry &#8212; quadrance and spread &#8212; reveal themselves in PGA to be precisely dual to each other, a fact not obvious in the original treatment. Furthermore, many of the derivations in PGA are, in my humble opinion, clearer and shorter than the coordinate-based ones in the original. I determined that the whole subject could probably be rephrased in this way using PGA but the lack of time has prevented further work in this direction. This experience is typical when I &#8220;translate&#8221; standard treatments of Euclidean geometry into PGA: often I discover a remarkable conciseness and elegance in the PGA version.</p>

<p>I am not a software purist; I used whatever helps me get the job done. Robustness and thorough documentation are my primary criteria. All my PGA investigations also involve visualization, so these two themes go hand-in-hand. Among commercial products, my favorite tool is Mathematica and I use it for prototype development. In fact, I used Mathematica to check all the results in my thesis for correctness.</p>

<p>For production software, I favor public domain software. Throughout my career (since writing my first hidden-surface removal algorithm on punch cards in 1978 at UNC-CH) I have developed such visualization software in parallel to my mathematical interests, as I found that existing 3D tools were/are generally not flexible enough to render what I wanted to. I worked on the <a href="http://www.geomview.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">geomview project</a> at the Geometry Center in the early 90&#8217;s. The latest incarnation in this direction is the <a href="http://www3.math.tu-berlin.de/jreality/jrealityStatic/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Java 3D scene graph jReality</a>, which I&#8217;ve been involved with at the TU Berlin since 2003. Like geomview, it is built on the foundation of projective geometry and can be then specialized to support different metric geometries such as Euclidean, hyperbolic, and spherical geometry, and has been further specialized by me for my PGA research.</p>
<p>I have also been learning Haskell recently since its pure functional, polymorphic style is particularly well-suited to reliably mapping mathematical domains such as PGA and it seems to be gaining quite a large following. I have looked at other GA packages, hoping to apply them to PGA, but at the time I looked none of them supported a degenerate metric (a key feature of Euclidean PGA). If anyone reading this knows of a standard GA package that supports a non-metric &#8220;duality&#8221; operator please let me know (projgeom@gmail.com).</p>

<p>My work on &#8220;generative sculpture&#8221; grew out of my experimenting with 3D printing at the 3D Lab of the TU Berlin beginning about 10 years ago. I was interested in printing polyhedra with different sorts of symmetry. I set myself the challenge of seeing whether I could maintain the identity of the polyhedron while smoothing out the &#8220;sharp corners&#8221; at the vertices, and <a href="http://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~gunn/Documents/Papers/ribbonEdges.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the &#8220;ribbon edges&#8221; paper</a> was the outcome. (For details see my web page at the TUB). Although there was no direct connection to projective geometry in this work, I do think projective geometry can have a similar effect &#8212; compared to Euclidean geometry (or any metric geometry) it is a much more flexible and mobile geometry and contains within it many possibilities for metamorphosis and polarities characteristic of change and interaction. These I think may have to do with how form, especially living form, emerges in the first place, before it arrives at its fixed Euclidean form. There&#8217;s much work that remains to be done in this direction, I believe projective geometry itself still contains lots of surprises for inquiring minds.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>The area of Scientific Visualization (SciViz) is an interdisciplinary branch of science. According to Friendly, it is "primarily concerned with the visualization of three-dimensional phenomena (architectural, meteorological, medical, biological, etc.), where the emphasis is on realistic renderings of volumes, surfaces, illumination sources, and so forth, perhaps with a dynamic (time) component". It is also considered a subset of computer graphics, a branch of computer science. The purpose of scientific visualization is to graphically illustrate scientific data to enable scientists to understand, illustrate, and glean insight from their data.<br />
In this post, I interview Dr. Werner Benger who describes his views on SciViz using Geometric Algebra and provides valuable insights about the use of SciViz in Big Data applications.</p>

<span class="dropcap">S</span><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_visualization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cientific Visualization</a> (SciViz)</strong> is a fascinating interdisciplinary branch of science. According to <a href="http://www.math.yorku.ca/SCS/Gallery/milestone/milestone.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Friendly</a>, it is &#8220;primarily concerned with the visualization of three-dimensional phenomena (architectural, meteorological, medical, biological, etc.), where the emphasis is on realistic renderings of volumes, surfaces, illumination sources, and so forth, perhaps with a dynamic (time) component&#8221;. It is also considered a subset of computer graphics, a branch of computer science. The purpose of scientific visualization is to graphically illustrate scientific data to enable scientists to understand, illustrate, and glean insight from their data.</p>
<p>In this post, I interview Dr. Werner Benger who describes his views on SciViz using Geometric Algebra and provides valuable insights about the use of SciViz in Big Data applications.</p>

<p>Basically, there are three purposes of visualization of scientific data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Presentation (when all is known about the data),</li>
<li>Analysis (when some questions need to be answered about the data),</li>
<li>Exploration (when we have no clue about the data yet and want to find out something new).</li>
</ul>
<p>Although user interface design is not necessarily part of SciViz, but in many cases, interactivity is needed. Particularly important is that the data that one deals with here are those with a spatio-temporal nature, it&#8217;s not just &#8220;any&#8221; data, but this specific subset.</p>
<p>Actually, I would not say that I have chosen to work in SciViz. It&#8217;s more that SciViz has chosen me. For most of the time I&#8217;ve considered myself rather an astrophysicist that became &#8220;delinquent&#8221; by engaging with computers too much. The origin came from the question how a black hole actually looks like. I asked that questions to one of my professors at university and he could not answer it, so I had to find out myself. I wrote a computer program for that purpose and that got me into this field. A couple of years ago I gave a presentation to students telling this story, you can find <a href="https://www.cct.lsu.edu/~werner/4REU2010.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the presentation slides here</a>.</p>

<p>As you mention Engineering vs. Computer Science &#8211; I often feel the difference between these two is that in Engineering you worry to get things to work &#8220;somehow&#8221;, while in Computer Science you also worry how things are getting to work and you want to find a systematic, future-safe approach. I&#8217;m myself more behind this theoretical approach to finding a powerful general solution that also but not only works for a special case, rather than just solving one particular special case. I also want to know why things work or why things cannot work, rather than finding an algorithm that solves a problem &#8220;somehow&#8221;.</p>

<p>My own approach to scientific visualization is focusing on finding general methods that allow encapsulation and reuse of code and algorithms. Computer programmers are inherently lazy people; otherwise, they would not use computers. I&#8217;m no exception for that, and particularly lazy such that I want to implement an algorithm or data operation once, and not over and over again for similar data types. Consequently what is needed is one common concept that covers many cases under the same hood. I found that to be true through my background in astrophysics in General Relativity (GR); since this theory makes many otherwise implicit assumptions explicit.</p>
<p>The same is also true about Geometric Algebra, which &#8220;unfolds&#8221; otherwise collapsed mathematical entities, such as vectors and bivectors, and clearly states the properties of each object in a systematic way. So it is this unfolding and clarification of concepts via GA and GR (namely differential geometry and topology) that opens the path to a common data model that is powerful and reusable for those many cases that one encounters in scientific visualization. It is an overhead for a particular case, so many people who do their work under time-pressure or a close horizon don&#8217;t see the benefit of a more general data model, but in the longer term it is significantly less work and opens development resources towards more interesting topics rather than dealing with myriads of similar cases. Here is an article titled &#8220;<a href="https://www.computer.org/cms/Computer.org/ComputingNow/homepage/2009/1109/rW_CS_SafariFileFormatJungle.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On Safari in the File Format Jungle</a>&#8221; that elaborates on this matter.</p>
<p>Systematic scientific visualization fuses all those interesting mathematical fields of differential geometry, topology, and geometric algebra. SciViz is also on the bridge between artwork and science, so touching both aspects is what many want, but only SciViz achieves if done well. You can read more about this aspect in my article &#8220;<a href="http://www.zib.de/hege/pdf/Benger-1999-Visions-of-numerical-relativity_SC-99-53.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visions of Numerical Relativity 1999</a>&#8220;.</p>

<p>Concerning new developments &#8211; that is certainly &#8220;Big Data&#8221;, which has become a buzzword that is all around now. With more and advanced numerical and observation technology available, the trend is to no longer filter data during generation, but to just retrieve and store anything possible, leaving the crucial problem of identifying &#8211; i.e., visualizing &#8211; the important aspects of the data to the last data processing step, the visualization. This is a topic by itself of course, but just to mention that Big Data is often considered synonymous with High-Performance Computing (HPC). Actually, SciViz only covers one aspect of HPC, but indeed many methods and approaches from HPC are needed to deal with SciViz, even on single PCs and laptops. There it is of course all about parallelism, about GPU computing, about parallel I/O, and about scaling up algorithms to deal with bigger amounts of data.</p>

<p>I always try to solve a GC problem via GA since GA is much richer in expressiveness than linear algebra and the chances that a seemingly complex algorithm can be solved by some simple but powerful elements taken out of a GA &#8220;toolbox&#8221; are high. Once you are used to thinking in terms of GA, things become easier that way, and thinking in terms of linear algebra feels like a knot in the brain. Like when talking about a &#8220;normal vector&#8221;, which is not really a vector, it&#8217;s merely identified with a vector, but what is actually a better representation is a bivector algebraically describing a plane&#8217;s direction in space.</p>
<p>This sometimes leads to passionate discussions with colleagues who still think about geometry in linear algebra and wonder how to rotate around an axis in 3D, when it&#8217;s so much easier to think about a rotation in a plane spun by two vectors. Such GA-based representation does not require any thinking, you &#8220;just do it&#8221;. But it is so hard for people to think about a bivector when talking about a plane if they are used to think about a plane&#8217;s normal vector instead, which in fact is a construct involving orthogonality and orientation, much more complex than the original object, the plane itself.</p>
<p>But then, even GA complicates matters by considering bivectors as oriented planes, but there&#8217;s not really a concept of a plane &#8220;as-is&#8221;, i.e. without orientation. That is something that can be borrowed from differential geometry as a covector, an unoriented plane, which by means of using an orientation (via the pseudoscalar) is identifiable with a bivector, then describing an oriented plane. And all those items are identified in linear vector algebra with the same object, a three-component vector.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s a bit of matter of taste which side is more confusing, the one identifying different geometric concepts into the same algebraic representation, or the one that unfolds a widely used geometric concept into more expressive algebraic objects. For my taste, the latter, and the more you have unfolded those geometric concepts, the better you understand which algebraic structures are required for identification &#8211; and those structures may be non-trivial in general, thus need to be considered explicitly in a general-purpose data model, even though via various optimization techniques they would vanish. This should be the last step, not the first one. &#8220;Implicit assumptions&#8221; are the death of data descriptions and file formats, there must at least be a way to identify which assumptions have been made, and they need to be part of the data description.</p>

How can we approach this effectively?</div><div class="su-service-content su-clearfix" style="padding-left:46px">
<p>When we classify algebraic properties of geometric concepts we obtain a &#8220;zoo&#8221; of vector types. This determines the metadata that needs to be written to a file (or other means of persistent storage such as a database) such that the data remain identifiable. Just writing floating point data is simple, but problems occur when the need arises to know what the data mean when reading them. Self-description of data is important for archival purposes and restartable algorithms, which are particularly important for long-term archiving and out-of-memory data processing. There are not many file formats that even provide the required expressivity of meta-data as required for this purpose to describe such variety of vectorial types.</p>

<p>XML is one option, especially in the web context, <strong><a href="https://www.hdfgroup.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HDF5</a></strong> is another one, designed for high-performance applications and big data. While via XML anything is in the open, in HDF5 there already is an API to describe the properties of types. In Addition, HDF5 provides functionality of type conversions, which in this context can be utilized to e.g. implicitly convert multivectors of different numerical precision or to read a partial multivector into full multivector (for instance, if data were written by an application that only knows about vectors, but later on these data are read into another application that only knows about full multivectors).</p>
<p>For a generic application, we need runtime type identification that maps a type description, may it be provided by HDF5 or another capable file format \ storage medium, into compile-time types such that the correct precompiled code for the respective vector types can be called. On the other hand, the I/O mechanisms should not need to know about the complexity of vector types, it only needs to know about arrays of floating points plus some metadata. Thus what is left is to map the compile-time type meta-information to some run-time meta-information about types. The mechanism of type traits comes into play here for writing data. For reading data, however, it is not sufficient. When a certain data type is identified in some persistent storage, the reading code has to look up some registry to find a routine that produces actual instances of data arrays of the given type (which is then known by application code only). Given such an application code produced data array, it remains sufficient for the reading code to look at its numerical values only.</p>

<p>Well, in theory, it&#8217;s a complementary part of simulation; in practice many scientists performing 3D or 4D simulations still only look at numbers or 1D plots. This is partly due to &#8220;old-style&#8221; scientists being used to 1D plots, as this was the only way of &#8220;visualization&#8221; decades ago, and color printing of images with 3D visualizations is not possible in traditional high-profile journals where they want to publish. The other problem is the inconvenience of dealing with big data and advanced visualization systems. While there are lots of fancy visualization equipment such as Caves and Walls, only very few would make use of such. The typical scientist would not make use of anything that doesn&#8217;t run on their laptops right away. Even going to another room for doing visualization on a higher-end machine is too much overhead for many &#8220;end-users&#8221; and they would not do it unless they are forced to.</p>
<p>For design and engineering of SciViz software, I&#8217;m an advocator for using a common data model. I.e., use one central data structure to route as many types of data through this one, instead of cooking many little solutions that may or may not fit together.</p>
<p>Concerning code readability, I believe code should be written in a most intuitive way; mathematical algorithms as close to the mathematical notation as possible. For example, operator overloading and C++ 14 string literals provide syntactic sugar to do so, but a naive implementation may suffer performance issues. Expression templates have demonstrated how human-readable code can be transformed into efficient code by using C++ templates. The more constraints are known about some code, the better it can be optimized, and systems such as Gaalop or GMac that rely on symbolic algebra packages may be able to optimize a certain algorithm even better than the more generic C++ compiler. It is thus desirable that a C++ library providing GA algorithm allows for application code that is not only human-readable but also readable as a domain-specific language such that it is parseable by tools beyond the C++ compiler itself.</p>

<p>GA is as helpful here in software design as it is helpful in bridging different mathematical applications, by showing a common, unifying basis. The difficulty here is similar to using a common data model: we need the most general possible way of considering GA, not merely a version of GA for one particular case, even though that one may be very broadly used.</p>
<p>For instance, this means considering GA in arbitrary coordinate systems, not merely in orthonormal coordinate systems, which is what most implementations of GA do &#8211; because mathematically, it can be done, and the problem is solved thereby. But it&#8217;s only mathematically solved, and in practice, non-orthonormal coordinate systems are more common; for instance in numerical relativity or in computational fluid dynamic simulations. GA-based implementations need to be as general as possible to cover all such applications that can use GA as an algebraic representation. At the same time, we need to keep the highly optimized reductions that are possible for special cases, and at this time some automatic code generators may come into play to allow specifying constraints and knowledge available for a particular use case (e.g. global orthonormality of coordinates) which are not available on the level of a compiler.</p>

<p>A certain difference is that one must avoid any overhead &#8220;per vector element&#8221; and consider doing operations on &#8220;arrays of multivectors&#8221;. This comes with constraints that need to be taken into consideration. Vish stems from a background of dealing with big data from numerical relativity and bases all its data operations on the concept of fiber bundles. This means operations are done as array operations as much as possible, which are parallelizable and allow optimal data throughput, for both I/O and transferring data on the graphics card for rendering. Modern rendering is based on vertex buffers and vertex arrays, which mathematically are fiber bundles, whereas the old OpenGL 1.0 was about primitives and lists of primitives. This model did not scale to the highly parallel data processing that happens on GPUs and thus is considered deprecated now, whereas the fiber bundle data model, envisioned originally by D. Butler in 1989, shines, even though only a few people are aware that they actually do fiber bundles.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="su-service"><div class="su-service-title" style="padding-left:46px;min-height:32px;line-height:32px"><i class="fa fa-comments-o" style="font-size:32px;color:#333"></i> What role does GA have in such Big-Data software design context?</div><div class="su-service-content su-clearfix" style="padding-left:46px">
<p>In this context, GA is complementary, as it basically implements fibers on the fiber bundle data model. So the basic change is to think about operations on arrays of multivectors and to extend solutions to consider array operations instead of single variables. Now that &#8220;should&#8221; be rather easy when an array of multivectors is homogenous, i.e. each array element consists of multivectors with the same zero and non-zero components. Fortunately, this will most likely be the case in practical applications, and code-generators such as GMac are able to predict which multivector components will always be zero within an algorithm &#8211; that is an essential part of applying GA algorithms for big data, both for computational speed and even more memory consumption.</p>
<p>For a single input operation, optimizing out zeroes is just some computational optimization, but the algorithm would still work without it. For big data having many inputs, keeping arrays which are all zero are performance killers and may prevent an entire application from becoming functional. So an optional optimization for small data applications becomes a mandatory component for big data applications. But things become really complex if we had to consider heterogeneous multivector arrays where the zeros would be different at each array element. This basically leaves us with two options: Carry all zeroes everywhere for the sake of parallelism, or use locally dynamic multivectors, which will be much slower but more memory-friendly. Let&#8217;s hope we don&#8217;t have many such application cases.</p>

<p>I would like to point out that Vish is adhering to <a href="http://vish.fiberbundle.net/download/license/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a particular license with a non-military aspect</a>. I think it&#8217;s important for developers of technology to also think how their technology can be used. Otherwise, the Oppenheimer effect may strike them later on. Many people would object, and promote &#8220;free software&#8221; just for the sake of freedom, saying the military would not respect a software license anyway. However, my experience on that matter has been just the opposite. It is respected, and I had a couple of requests from the military that I was putting down, and it was accepted.</p>

<p>This is a good and unsolved question. Actually, I don&#8217;t think much can be done to change the mind of current researchers, but new ones will embrace new technology in a natural way, similar to kids growing up with smartphones, while their grandparents still disapproving them. Parts of the process is due to the technology not just becoming functional, but also easy and available to use.</p>
<p>There is not much point of trying to &#8220;force&#8221; users into some technology, that is not really sustainable, but there are many people out there that would want to make their technology to be used and available, yet they struggle with the simple issue of obtaining funding for it, because in the scientific world, you don&#8217;t get papers and publications for making your software easier to use. It&#8217;s more the scientific publication culture, or rather, using &#8220;scientific publications&#8221; as a measure for funding agencies that inhibits making such tools easier. SciViz, in particular, has the problem that everyone wants and likes glossy images to present and sell their work, but hardly anyone wants to invest resources into it or pay for it. There are few exceptions, for instance, I heard about research centers with the policy that 10% of all project budgets must be allocated for doing visualization; this is a great model. By that model, even projects that don&#8217;t need visualization contribute to visualization research and deployment. With a proper funding model for SciViz development and supplementing, development and increased use of advanced SciViz tools will come naturally.</p>
<p>On the other hand, GA is more an educational topic, it does not really help to understand a data analysis in its entity, it could only help to understand a certain data analysis tool or method, to see what it does. But understanding the data itself is independent, and that is up to the scientist who produced the data to determine whether GA is of benefit in this step. But similar to SciViz tools, there is no point of trying to enforce or promote GA to those who don&#8217;t want it, but those who don&#8217;t know it yet should be made aware that it exists and what it is good for, and that should be done as early as possible in someone&#8217;s learning career. Of course, the problem is that it comes with a choice &#8211; it can be used or not, so to not burden people with unnecessary mental ballast, it would not be taught early on. But at least, it should be mentioned, so people inspired by it can look it up themselves.</p>

<div class='content-column three_fourth'><h3>About Professor Eduardo Bayro</h3>
<p>Professor Eduardo Bayro started working on the applications of GA in the late 1990’s. His work is to stress the application of GA in cybernetics which typically involves Robotics, Neural Computing, Computer Vision, and Lie Algebras. Using GA-based geometric computing he tackled problems related to the building of intelligent machines, particularly Humanoids, to formulate algorithms for dealing with computer graphics curves, spheres, hyperplanes, and simple geometric tasks. Another goal is to build intelligent machines with real devices using geometric control, geometric perception and even quaternion wavelet transform, quaternion spike, or quantum quaternion neurons. Currently, he is preparing a new book series of 3 volumes on these topics. He is laying out the theory of future geometric intelligent robots and machines with powerful FPGA and Nvidia geometric accelerators.</p></div>

<p>Geometric Algebra (GA) is a powerful geometric language for the modeling of the physics of systems. It is a highly intuitive language and provides many algebraic tools very useful to tackle complex equation manipulations. GA allows economical representations of transformations due to the GA multivector representation as opposite to analytic geometry or vector calculus. GA-based representations avoid redundant parameters and elegantly encapsulate the geometry of the problem. As a result due to its economical representations, GA is a well-suited framework for the development of real-time computations.</p>

<p>GA achieves the unification of many domains like multilinear algebra, multivariable analysis, conformal geometry, Lie group and Lie algebras, projective geometry, quantum mechanics and general relativity. GA allows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extending and completing algebraic operations on vectors and multi-vectors.</li>
<li>Providing unified concepts for geometry and algebra.</li>
<li>Providing explicit interpretation of geometric entities and operations on them in arbitrary dimensions with Euclidean and pseudo-Euclidean metrics.</li>
<li>Acting as an advanced formalism for rotations and in general Lie groups in arbitrary dimensions.</li>
<li>Acting as a metalanguage for high-level reasoning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of these features, Geometric Algebra has a wide range of applications: graphics engineering, signal and image processing, computer vision, neural networks and quantum computing, machine learning, and robotics.</p>

<p>Recent achievements in geometric accelerators using packets like Versor (P. Colapinto) or Gaalop (Geometric Algebra Algorithms Optimizer, D. Hildenbrand) allow us with FPGA or NVidia to accelerate computations even more. In my lab, we develop and build intelligent machines like in medical robotics or humanoids. The development of GA algorithms follows: algorithmic modeling, using our own C++ programs or Versor, then simply the algorithms with Maple or Gaalop and accelerate them with either FPFGA or Nvidia. The results are quite impressive for real time applications and the visualization of computing in higher dimensions which in turn helps us to gain insight and achieve correctness in the prove of theorems and improve the performance of our algorithms. We are working now to develop in the next 3 years a single small chip for geometric computing using GA with a power superior as the <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/jetson-tk1-embedded-dev-kit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jetson TK1 Nvidia</a> card.</p>

<p>The tricky question is what should be a true geometric learning? We started by generalizing the McCulloch-Pitts neuron replacing its inner product via the geometric product, so the neural network weights are then multivectors and the learning rules are formulated using the gradient of multivectors as well. Our networks for classification via their kernels map the data using multivectors to a direct product of Hilbert spaces to separate multivector clusters, this helps a lot to find optimal hyperplanes. We have worked on geometric neural computing since 1995, in fact, we have generalized in GA most of the neural networks: i.e. multivector valued [SOM, NeuralGAS, MLP, ART], Clifford SVM and Quaternion Spike neural Network, currently we are developing the quaternion quantum Neural Network. This year we are also focusing on geometric high-order recurrent Neural Networks.</p>

<p>I have been teaching since 1997 using the material of my work which was then published in two books:</p>
<ul>
<li>Geometric Computing for Perception Action Systems. Eduardo Bayro-Corrochano, Springer-Verlag, April 2001.</li>
<li>Geometric Computing: for Wavelet Transforms, Robot Vision, Learning, Control, and Action. Eduardo Bayro-Corrochano, Springer-Verlag, 2010.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am preparing a more comprehensive series in three volumes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vol. I: GA for computer vision and machine learning,</li>
<li>Vol. II: GA for Robotics,</li>
<li>Vol. III: GA for Signal Processing, Filtering, Transforms and Quantum Computing.</li>
</ul>
<p>These three volumes are based on my first two books, of course, while including new exciting results. My books generally differ from many the current books on GA applications because my books cover computer vision, graphics engineering, neural networks, machine learning, robotics, integral transforms, and ultimately the endeavor of building intelligent machines with GA; they present real applications. The other books are more related to the foundations of GA and its restricted use to the develop algorithms in computer science and its sub-fields like computer graphics. That is why my continuous work during all these years is helping to be able to prepare these new three volumes, which I believe will certainly establish the true geometric computing for the future development of intelligent machines.</p>

<p>I call for studying and applying GA for future cybernetics in my lectures at different universities in Europe, North America (MIT) and Latin America. I have students with different backgrounds as in physics, mathematics, or engineering; some well prepared for some topics and less for others, so I start as in a fractal approach for conveying knowledge:</p>
<ul>
<li>We study 2D- and 3D-GA to become acquainted with the formulation of the geometric primitives and the use of different Clifford operations.</li>
<li>Then we model the kinematics of points, lines and planes particularly to understand well screw theory and differential kinematics.</li>
<li>Then I explain the basic of differential geometry like the Geometric Laplace-Beltrami Operator for applications in Euclidean and pseudo-Euclidean spaces.</li>
<li>We study in depth Lie Groups and Lie algebras using spinors and versors for Euclidean, Affine, and 2D and 3D projective geometry.</li>
<li>Then I explain projective geometry using Euclidean and Minkowski metrics for the projective plane and spaces and extensions of the projective space in R(3,3).</li>
</ul>
<p>In this manner, the students have learned the most important ingredients to move the Conformal Geometric Algebra and high dimensional geometric algebras like G(6,3) and G(8,2). Thanks to our optimized routines for GA in C++ (with NVidia) and Maple (using the Clifford 14.0 package of R. Ablamowicz), we can prove theorems and develop real-time algorithms for intelligent machines.</p>

What sort of satisfaction do you get when working on your primary interests?</div><div class="su-service-content su-clearfix" style="padding-left:46px">
<p>My primary interest is the interplay between geometry and its algebraic representation. It is great fun to derive some equation solving a problem, and then hearing it begin to talk to you about aspects you had never considered in the original formulation. This works most strongly in GA, which is why I love that framework. However, it is hard to find funding for this in abstracto. I am currently tying it into a project on restoring broken archaeological artifacts based on 3D scans (project-gravitate.eu); in a theoretical work package, this pulls in my earlier work on geometric path planning and mathematical morphology and offers an opportunity to study finite elements methods from a GA point of view.</p>

<p>GA clears your mind and your software, even when you decide to stick to LA in practice (at least, in the beginning). The disgusting number of different terms and techniques in LA which are all, in hindsight, ways to avoid using the outer product are a good example. Once you realize that outer product exists, much of the operations described in natural language (like &#8216;span&#8217;) coherently collapse to elementary and compact algebraic operations under your own control. Certainly, in computer science where 3D is just not enough (the spaces involved in machine learning are very high-dimensional), the outer product MUST be taught. And once you have the outer product, you might as well absorb the geometric product for generalized projections and rejections. As for operators, use rotors instead of quaternions, so you have something that is real and that generalizes to n-D.</p>

<p>After I just learned GA, I was amazed by the clarity it provides at the computational basis for geometry, and its new elements and operators at an intermediate level of abstraction: it is great to have the very interesting new primitives, especially in CGA (conformal geometric algebra). What can we do more or better once we learn to think in terms of those primitives? I knew I could not develop the consequences for intermediate and high-level algorithms myself &#8212; there is just too much reform to do, in too many fields. So we wrote a book to convey the basic tools and the algebraically supported intuition of their interplay, for others to do that work, each in their own subfield. It has not quite taken off yet in the way I hoped, though there are some examples (such as work by Ishida at Honda on genetic algorithms for road-following using GA primitives and their interactions as the chromosomes and cross-over operations). We need more work at that intermediate level, showing how or when the possibility not to go down to the vector level pays off.</p>

<p>At some point it would be good to collate some convincing applications of the new thinking, directly employing the intermediate primitives (like the Honda example above, or the application to GIS). Our 2011 &#8216;Guide to GA in Practice&#8217; contains some good chapters in those directions, but a proper book would need more tight editorial coherence. I would like to see parts on projective geometric algebra since that is so important to graphics (I believe R(3,3) is the right model, but we still need to learn to encode the world in its primitives, the line complexes), and on finite element methods done in GA (with special emphasis on 3D meshes).</p>

Tell us about the difficulties you faced and the satisfaction you felt during your journey with GA until now.</div><div class="su-service-content su-clearfix" style="padding-left:46px">
<p>When I started to work with GA in 2003, I was immediately very impressed how easy it is to develop 3D algorithms dealing with geometric objects and operations based on GA. I was very happy to use a tool providing me an immediate visual result for mathematical expressions: CLUCalc from Christian Perwass. I am still developing most of my GA algorithms with CLUCalc and, in my opinion, CLUCalc is still today the best tool in order to learn how to use Geometric Algebra for 3D applications.</p>
<p>In 2004, when I organized and presented a GA tutorial at the Eurographics conference in Grenoble together with Christian Perwass, Daniel Fontijne, and Leo Dorst, the feedback was positive and negative at the same time.<br />
On one hand, many people were happy about the expressiveness of GA, but on the other hand, it was clear for everybody that implementations of computer graphics applications were not competitive in terms of runtime performance.</p>
<p>I realized that improving the runtime performance of GA will be the key to convincing engineers to use GA in their applications. At that time, nobody really expected that it could be possible for implementations of GA algorithms to be faster than the conventional implementation. But, in 2006, we were happy to present even two different implementations proving exactly that for a computer animation application (the movement of the arm of a virtual character).</p>

What were your initial expectations when you started working on that topic? What is its current state? How do you see the future of GAC and its applications in computer science and engineering?</div><div class="su-service-content su-clearfix" style="padding-left:46px">
<p>Our approach for the just mentioned proof-of-concept application was very specific. This is why our next goal was a general system making it possible for almost every engineer to include GA in his/her application. And, the description of GA algorithms should be as much as possible similar to how CLUCalc ist doing that.</p>
<p>Now, we are happy to provide the Gaalop (Geometric Algebra Algorithms Optimizer) precompiler for the integration of GA into standard programming languages such as C++, OpenCL, CUDA and C++ AMP.</p>
<p>The integration is done based on GaalopScript, which is very much inspired by the CLUCalc scripting language. This technology is described in my book &#8220;Foundations of Geometric Algebra Computing&#8221; from 2013. Since 2015 this technology is part of the ecosystem of the HSA Foundation of more than 40 companies dealing with new heterogeneous computing architectures. Now, we have this technology available, as well as some other GA tools such as GMac, Gaigen, Gaalet and Versor, but the community working with it is still very small. The future of GAC and its applications in computer science and engineering relies heavily on whether we will succeed in closing this gap.</p>

<div class="su-service"><div class="su-service-title" style="padding-left:46px;min-height:32px;line-height:32px"><i class="fa fa-comments-o" style="font-size:32px;color:#333"></i> What steps do you think should the GA community take to gain wider spread of GA among the larger community of engineers and computer scientists?</div><div class="su-service-content su-clearfix" style="padding-left:46px">
<p>Today, we indeed have this GAC technology available for easy to develop, geometrically intuitive, robust and fast engineering applications, but there is still only a small number of people knowing it. Exactly at this point, the book &#8220;Introduction to Geometric Algebra Computing&#8221;, that I am just writing, comes into place. The main goal of this book is to close the gap with an introduction of GA from an engineering/computing perspective. The intended audiences are students, engineers, and researchers interested in learning GAC. This book is intended to give a rapid introduction to the computing with Geometric Algebra and its power for geometric modeling. From the geometric objects point of view, it focuses on the most basic ones, namely points, lines, and circles. We call this algebra Compass Ruler Algebra since you are able to handle it comparable to working with compass and ruler. It offers the possibility to compute with these geometric objects and their geometric operations and transformations in a very intuitive way. While focusing on 2D it is easily expandable to 3D computations as used in many books dealing with the very popular Conformal Geometric Algebra in engineering applications such as computer graphics, computer vision, and robotics. This book follows a top-down approach. Focusing first on how to use GA, it is up to the reader how much he/she would like to go into the details.</p>
<p>Another attempt to gain wider spread is the ENGAGE (Empowering Novel Geometric Algebra for Graphics &amp; Engineering) workshop as part of the CGI (Computer Graphics International) conference. This year, this will be in Japan (<a href="http://fj.ics.keio.ac.jp/cgi17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://fj.ics.keio.ac.jp/cgi17/</a>). But, sure, there is still the need of many good ideas in order to attract more and more engineers.</p>

From your point of view, what steps are required in the near future to reach a wide acceptance of this idea? What are the difficulties you see facing its achievement?</div><div class="su-service-content su-clearfix" style="padding-left:46px">
<p>Yes, you are right, I already have some experience with GA at schools. Because of its geometric intuitiveness, it is very easy for children to develop algorithms in GA. In some workshops, I could see that children are happy to solve simple robotics problems which they normally are not able to before university. A colleague of mine already taught special relativity based on GA at school. But the main problem is to make GA really part of the curriculum. Maybe some teachers/responsibles for curricula will use my above mentioned new book for teaching themselves and for introducing it already in school.</p>

<p>Geometric Algebra research is not only revolutionizing algorithm development in many fields (robotics, visualization, mapping, virtual reality, GIS, molecular dynamics, telecommunication, offshore mechatronics, 3D cadastres, navigation, &#8230;), it also begins to exhibit superior accuracy, stability, and speed, and is increasingly introduced in mainstream computing ecosystems.</p>

<p>In neural computing and signal processing, Geometric Algebra allows to generalize 1D and 2D algorithms seamlessly to higher dimensions with great advantages for electromagnetic signals, including light and color, and it fully captures, analyzes and reproduces complex high dimensional geometric relationships and topology.

<p>Be ready to unlearn often inefficient, inaccurate, unintuitive matrix methods and systems of linear equations.

Resist the initial temptation to fall back into coordinate system component techniques, which hide geometric realities behind veils of stupendous numerical arrays. Expect to liberate your geometric intuition, and be able to work with an advanced single universal integrative mathematical system for whatever problem or task you may face in the future.</p>

<p>Organizing sessions and workshops at major science and engineering conferences is a good way. International collaborative projects might be another. Submitting research papers to all types of science and engineering journals, when the applications topic permits that, rather than highly specialized journals. Preprints published ASAP on servers like vixra.org, preprint.org, etc. and open access, will also help. In addition, sharing lectures and software demos on YouTube will help interested students, professionals, and engineers to know about geometric algebra even outside formal educational and academic workshop settings.</p>

<div class='content-column three_fourth'><h3><strong>About Dr. Garret Sobczyk</strong></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.garretstar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Garret Sobczyk</a> is Emeritus Professor of Mathematics, Universidad de las Americas-Puebla, Mexico. Dr. Sobczyk first learned about Clifford geometric algebras from Prof. David Hestenes as a graduate student in mathematics at Arizona State University in 1966. He became convinced early on that geometric algebra is rightly considered to be the completion of the real number system to include the concept of direction. He obtained his Ph.D. in mathematics in 1971 and eagerly set forth to convince the world. This quest led him to spend 5 years in Poland as a postdoctoral student at the Institute of Theoretical Physics in Wroclaw, before returning to the United States in 1983. He coauthored with Prof. David Hestenes the book, “Clifford Algebra to Geometric Calculus: A Unified Language for Mathematics and Physics”, published in 1985. He held several academic positions in the United States and Mexico, before settling with his Polish wife Wanda at the Universidad de Las Americas in Cholula, Mexico in 1993. He has published over 30 articles exploring the close relationships between geometric algebra and linear and multilinear algebra and other topics and is a member of Sistema Nacional de Investigadores de Mexico.</p></div>

<p>Thank you, Ahmad, for giving me the opportunity to share with you some of my early memories as a graduate student at Arizona State University (ASU) working in geometric algebra.</p>
<p>It was in 1965 when I had just completed my Master’s Degree in Mathematics and was looking for direction to continue my studies for a Ph.D. that I decided to explore possibilities in mathematical physics. Professor David Hestenes, a new professor at ASU, was offering a course in electrodynamics that caught my attention. On the first day of class, he began by introducing Geometric Algebra (GA) and the geometric product of vectors. I was amazed that I had never heard of the concept of a bivector as a directed area, or of the geometric product of vectors. It was over the course of that year that I decided that I wanted to dedicate my efforts for my Ph.D. into developing GA as a basic language in mathematics that I believed it to be then, and still do now a half a century later!</p>
</div></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="su-service"><div class="su-service-title" style="padding-left:46px;min-height:32px;line-height:32px"><i class="fa fa-comments-o" style="font-size:32px;color:#333"></i> I suspect it wasn't easy for you to learn and apply Geometric Algebra back then. What did you do?</div><div class="su-service-content su-clearfix" style="padding-left:46px">
<p>Indeed, I did not have an easy beginning. David, at first suggested topics in Kellogg’s Potential Theory and Harmonic Analysis or generalizing Elliptic Functions. All of these were very good topics which have been extensively developed by European groups such as the Delanghe-Sommen group in Belgium, and others, but I was unable to make any real progress in these areas. It was at this point, almost in desperation, that I started to look at very basic ideas in linear algebra and differential geometry. Surely, if GA was indeed a basic language (over the continual skepticism of my Father; then a Professor of Mathematics at Clemson University, with a Ph.D. from Princeton University when he was a 23 year old), GA should offer new insights in these basic fields. Even to this day, most mathematicians believe that trying to reformulate differential geometry in GA is only putting old wine in new bottles.</p>

<p>I undertook a serious study of linear and multilinear algebra out of books by Gel’fand, Shilov, and Greub, and basic differential geometry. I was also greatly influenced by books such as “Science Awakening” by van der Waerden, Tobias Dantzig’s book, “Number The Language of Science”, Wilder’s “Evolution of Mathematical Concepts”, and Michael Crowe’s “History of Vector Analysis”. I considered my first “breakthrough” in linear algebra to be when I discovered how to derive the Cayley-Hamilton theorem in GA by first looking at the simplest 2-dimensional case. I spent a great deal of time developing the notion of the vector and simplicial derivatives in GA as a basic tool in linear algebra. Almost all of my 1971 Ph.D. thesis consisted of a systematic development of the general simplicial derivative as a basic tool in linear algebra.</p>
<p>It was only toward the end of my thesis that I was able to start making progress in laying down the basic ideas of Riemannian Curvature in differential geometry, material which David and I developed further over a period of four years afterwards, and would later make up the heart of our book “Clifford Algebra to Geometric Calculus: A Unified Language for Mathematics and Physics”, which wasn’t published until a decade later in 1984.</p>

<h3>Facing the Real World</h3>
<div class="su-service"><div class="su-service-title" style="padding-left:46px;min-height:32px;line-height:32px"><i class="fa fa-comments-o" style="font-size:32px;color:#333"></i> Tell us about your steps after finishing your Ph.D. Were you able to easily get recognition for your groundbreaking work with Prof. Hestenes?</div><div class="su-service-content su-clearfix" style="padding-left:46px">
<p>After finishing my Ph.D. at ASU in 1971, I was unsuccessful in obtaining any academic position. The first academic job crunch was on and for every teaching position at a University or College there were hundreds of applicants, and Mathematics Departments to which I applied were suspicious of me working in an unknown area and with a young theoretical physicist as my thesis adviser. Fortunately, ASU kept me on for an additional year as a Visiting Assistant Professor, which gave us the chance to continue working closely together in developing GA. At first, we planned on publishing four papers, which later formed the basis of our book. The following year, I was still unsuccessful in obtaining any academic position.</p>
<p>At first, I visited a number of American University Mathematics Departments with well-known people in differential geometry, but none were interested in GA or in my work. I also realized that my basic knowledge of differential geometry was insufficient to convince anyone of any need to reformulate it in a new language. In 1973, I visited European Universities in different countries and was invited to give a number of talks about GA, but it was only in Poland that I was offered a Research Fellowship with the Polish Academy of Sciences, which allowed me to continue to develop basic tools in GA that eventually went into our book CA to GC in 1984. I returned to Poland in 1976 with a Postdoctoral Research Grant from Stoney Brook University in NY, allowing me to continue my work with new colleagues at the Institute of Theoretical Physics in Wroclaw until 1980.</p>

<p>I enjoyed two academic appointments as an Assistant and Associate professor of Mathematics at Spring Hill College, Mobile, Ala., and at Lander College, Greenwood, SC in the 1980’s, and began developing material to teach undergraduate students GA and calculus. Finally, in 1984, our book CA to GC was published, which provided a needed boost to my career, but even to this day, the book has been largely ignored by the majority of the Mathematics Community.</p>
<p>It was difficult to teach GA and GC to students at this level because it usually takes a full year to get students comfortable with GA, and an undergraduate student is expected to master many other subjects as well. As my Finnish friend and colleague, the late Professor Pertti Lounesto remarked, about the best you can do is “smuggled it in” under the guise of closely related material, such as vector analysis and differential forms.</p>

Did the situation get better at a later stage?</div><div class="su-service-content su-clearfix" style="padding-left:46px">
<p>Fortunately, during the 1990’s and into the new century, Professor Hestenes was successful at drawing considerable new interest to the area among computer scientists and engineers, by utilizing GA in an innovative way to lay down the foundations of projective and conformal geometries.</p>
<p>In 1990 I accepted a very promising offer by Professor Jaime Keller of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico to work with him as Assistant Editor of the new International Journal that he was creating, “Advances in Applied Clifford Algebras”, with the hope of both consolidating this growing field of research, and promoting wider international recognition. It was an exciting two years of growth, and of discovering the exotic culture of modern Mexico, alongside the ancient Mayan civilization that may well have been among the earliest to invent the concept of the number zero, and a base 20 type number system.</p>

<p>At the Universidad de Las Americas &#8211; Puebla, over the years 1993 &#8211; present, I continued to develop material for teaching GA at the undergraduate level, with an emphasis on basic linear algebra and elementary differential geometry, leading to the publication of my book, “New Foundations in Mathematics: The Geometric Concept of Number”, Birkhauser-Springer 2013. In this book, I emphasize the development of linear algebra and basic ideas of differential geometry in terms of GA, including the basic concept of the spectral basis. The idea of a spectral basis is what really connects the ideas of a geometric algebra to the traditional approaches to linear algebra and ubiquitous matrices. When GA is properly understood as providing a geometric basis for matrices, the well-established consistency of matrix algebra, in turn, proves the mathematical soundness of GA, without the need to go into more complicated arguments involving tensor analysis and the higher level abstract concepts of advanced mathematics. Also, in the book, I lay down preliminary material on application of the idea of a spectral basis in basic ideas in numerical analysis, such as Hermite interpolation and rational approximation.</p>

<h3>Present and Future</h3>
<div class="su-service"><div class="su-service-title" style="padding-left:46px;min-height:32px;line-height:32px"><i class="fa fa-comments-o" style="font-size:32px;color:#333"></i> How do you see the current state of GA and GC among researchers?</div><div class="su-service-content su-clearfix" style="padding-left:46px">
<p>Clifford analysis, as developed by various groups, both in the United States and Europe enjoys recognition as a respectable area of research in advanced mathematics. In addition to the work of Professor Hestenes, Professor Baylis in Canada, other researchers in Mexico, China and around the World, geometric algebra has enjoyed increasing success among theoretical physicists in relativity and quantum mechanics. Clifford algebra is also used by some of the top theoretical physicists at prestigious universities in string theory and its generalizations. As you know, it has also attracted significant and growing attention in the computer science and engineering communities.</p>

<div class="su-service"><div class="su-service-title" style="padding-left:46px;min-height:32px;line-height:32px"><i class="fa fa-comments-o" style="font-size:32px;color:#333"></i> What are your expectations of the future of GA and GC in teaching? What kind of research do you believe should be conducted to effectively relate GA and GC to mainstream mathematics and applications?</div><div class="su-service-content su-clearfix" style="padding-left:46px">
<p>I have no easy answer to this question. One of the main obstacles to teaching GA is the lack of powerful computer software to aid and check abstract hand calculations, although many new software products are becoming available. Two software packages that I have found to be useful in my teaching and research is the original stand-alone early numerical software package “CLICAL” by Lounesto, and the Mexican developed Mathematica Package [cliffordt.nb] 2007, by G. Aragon-Camarasa, J.L. Aragon, and M.A. Rodriguez. There are quite are a number of recent attempts to introduce GA at the undergraduate level that I am aware of. However, GA is still hardly recognized at all at the undergraduate level, as I firmly believe that it should be. I believe that it is the natural completion of the concept of number to include the concept of direction, and it should be taught that way down into the high school level. It is in this area that I have concentrated my own efforts. There is much left to be done to correctly lay down the foundations, even at a fundamental level, in order to facilitate progress at progressively more advanced levels in mathematics, physics, computer science, and engineering, including diverse areas such as quantum computing, robotics, the structure Lie groups and Lie Algebras, and artificial intelligence. The future lies in the hands of the younger generations.</p>

<p>Geography is the study of the earth and its’ features, inhabitants, and phenomena, which is a discipline system studying the interaction, changes and spatial difference in all spheres of earth surface system. So, about 80% of everyday information is strongly related to the geographic position, and can all be called Geographic information.</p>
<p>GIS is a comprehensive technology system used for collecting, processing, management, analysis, expression and transmission of geographic information. The strong capabilities of data analysis and processing make GIS like the brain of Geography. Therefore, GIS can be a key platform not only for Geography research but also for social services. Until now, GIS is applied to various areas like resource investigation, environmental assessment, disaster prediction, land management, transportation, military police, water conservancy and so on.</p>
<p>To a country, GIS is closely linked to national development and security. For example, when first Gulf War broke out, the US military had won a decisive victory at a modest price, hitting the Iraqi army with a precise strike. The City GIS system of Iraqi, which is built with the help of U.S., provides critical battlefield geographic information to the U.S., largely determining the outcome of the war.</p>

<p>To industry applications, GIS undoubtedly enhances the production efficiency. Let’s take China’s logistics industry as an example. GIS established a perfect management system for it, which includes supply management, personnel management, path planning and so on. So, everyone can sit at home to buy all the things from Internet and then get your commodities after one or two days. To everyone’s daily life, “Uber Taxi” may be one of the best examples of GIS applications. People can search the taxi at service nearby, plan the route to your own destination with real-time calculated prices and query for interest points around all by smartphones, which profoundly changes the way travel.</p>

<p>GIS is an interdisciplinary science and makes use of many advanced achievements of Engineering and Computer Science. The major branches directly related to GIS applications I think are Topography, Graphics, Data Science and High-performance heterogeneous computing. Topography provides the data source and measurement calculation methods to GIS, and Data Science instructs the data storage, management, and analysis process of GIS data models. Graphics provides strong tools for GIS visualization. At last, High-performance heterogeneous computing gives GIS an efficient method for calculating, which is the energy of GIS applications.</p>

<p>According to the characteristics of GIS mentioned above, geographical objects expression and computation based on Euclidean geometry are highly dependent on object coordinates and coordinate systems and the expression and analysis of different dimensional geographical objects are at disunity. So, we need to find out a corresponding unified coordinate system to represent the geographical objects of a different scale from global to local. In GIS, we are not only studying the geographical objects but also the geographical phenomena and geographical process. Geographical phenomena and process are usually characterized as multidimensional features and span many different spatio-temporal scales. Moreover, as the fusion analysis of geometric objects with different dimensions, it is rather difficult to be linked and integrated effectively with geographical models. All in all, in GIS, we have got a lot of multi-source heterogeneous data which is referenced as geometry and developed much more analysis models which are referenced as algebra, but they cannot be integrated appropriately.</p>
</div></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="su-service"><div class="su-service-title" style="padding-left:46px;min-height:32px;line-height:32px"><i class="fa fa-comments-o" style="font-size:32px;color:#333"></i> So what benefits can Geometric Algebra provide in this context?</div><div class="su-service-content su-clearfix" style="padding-left:46px">
<p>Based on philosophical and physical considerations, it seems that only Geometry Algebra can solve these problems effectively. As a unified descriptive language, GA can connect algebra and geometry, mathematics and physics, abstract space-time and entity space-time. So, introducing GA to GIS has a prospective to improve the multidimensional expression and analysis ability of GIS.</p>
<p>Products in GA define spatial operation sets as geometries, measurements, topologies and directions, and have the ability to achieve expression and mutual transformation among various kinds of space, and thus support unification and expression of various algebra and geometric system. Under the GA framework, operation rules and operators are designed to support the complex geometric calculation, in order to construct GIS computing engine based on GA.</p>
<p>The ability of geometric computation and expression in GA makes time an equivalent dimension to space in computational space construction, thus the expression and computation of unified time and space are achieved. For example, if we want to track a ship moving in the ocean together with cameras (optical remote sensing), sonar (acoustic remote sensing) and radar (electromagnetic remote sensing), we have to deal with images, waves, and fields with different speeds through very large scales, we need to integrate different spatio-temporal references. And classical Euclidean geometry will be invalid for this situation due to numerical computational precision. However, with GA, we can easily deal with this situation using frame-based representations and versors like what we have already done in spacetime algebra.</p>
<p>GA intrinsically mixes the dimensional computation of definite geometric meaning, achieves integrative expression and storage of objects of different dimensions in mathematical structures, and supports expression, modeling, and analysis of complex geographical phenomena and geographical process.</p>
<p>GIS data models and analysis models can also be extended in GA framework, which will help to build a unified descriptive framework of multidimensional geographical time and space. Besides, present analysis models and algorithms such as statistical model, dynamic model, and differential equation model can be inherited and unified to support geographical models and compact integration of GIS analysis and geographical analysis.</p>

<h3>Simulations</h3>
<div class="su-service"><div class="su-service-title" style="padding-left:46px;min-height:32px;line-height:32px"><i class="fa fa-comments-o" style="font-size:32px;color:#333"></i> As I understand, simulation plays a fundamental role in GIS research and applications.

<p>The real world is complex, so does the geographic information obtained from the world. GIS is considered as a common platform, which needs a spatio-temporal coordinate system, static or dynamic state, and geographical phenomena or process. This condition leads to the huge amount of heterogeneous data, geometric or algebraic expressions, and analysis models. So, the difficulties of creating good GIS simulators I think maybe in four aspects:</p>
<p>(1) How to develop a unified spatio-temporal framework that can integrate geographical objects, phenomenon and geoscience data at different scales with different characteristics? How to make the translation and coupling of the global spatio-temporal framework/reference with a local or several local frameworks/references seamlessly.</p>
<p>(2) How to develop an efficient scene-based data model that can not only have enough power to represent real geographic objects/phenomenon in a parametric way but also can support efficient organization, storage, computation and visualization in current computer framework.</p>
<p>(3) How to integrate users with different requirements (e.g. geographer, common publics, policy makers, developers and computer scientists) with a common, flexible but powerful expression and computation language, which can both easy use but also efficient for dynamical computing.</p>
<p>(4) How to deal with dynamical simulation and continues data updating and visualization by coupling various different geographical models. How can we combine them in an integrating framework and make them work together.</p>
</div></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="su-service"><div class="su-service-title" style="padding-left:46px;min-height:32px;line-height:32px"><i class="fa fa-comments-o" style="font-size:32px;color:#333"></i> How do you think GA can be used to create better GIS simulators?</div><div class="su-service-content su-clearfix" style="padding-left:46px">
<p>The above three conflicts all points to one thing: that a transmission tool is an urgent need. So, Geometric Algebra is found from the areas of mathematics and physics to act as a convergence tool. The unity of geometry and algebra, time and space, different dimensions, expression and computation of GA is just as the effective way to solve the existing problem.</p>
<p>In our past work, we have done the Multi-dimensional complex object expression based on Blade, the Multi-dimensional complex scenes expression based on Multivector, and the Multi-dimensional unified computation based on geometric algebra, which laid the foundation for the new GIS simulator through the data structure, expression, and calculation.</p>
<p>GA can effectively represent the relationship and measurement of different shapes, and Multivectors can realize the integration and unification of different dimensions and types of geometric objects. Then in the computation part, GA calculation is almost based on operators, which have good compatibility with various analysis models, such as dynamic model or differential equation model. A famous example is the expression of Maxwell’s equation, which can be transformed into a single equation by GA. So, to geographic computation, it’s of great significance to integrating and optimizing the existing models.</p>
<p>In the GA simulation, a series of compilers can be created to translate all these models into GA expressions, and then into the C++ codes, which improves the efficiency and reduces the computational complexity. On the basis of those compilers, high-performance heterogeneous parallel computing can also be easily realized. Above all, GA does the overall rebuild to the old simulators and makes GIS simulators more efficient, concise and smart.</p>

<p>In GAGIS, the most impressive thing for me is that all of the researchers had done excellent works in their research area. Because of the characteristics of GIS, It attracts people in many directions and fields. During the meeting, each researcher made a wonderful report and after the report, the participants put out a lot of questions and I also learned much about it from their response. On the last day of the meeting, we also visited the laboratory and learn about the wonderful work that they had done.</p>
<p>As a common platform, GIS has the potential to support the development and application of geometric algebra and its related fields as a representative work. For example, image processing can rely on the GIS platform to design the corresponding image processing algorithms and validate it directly with GIS data. However, until now, all we have done is primary, and we need to collaborate with the international GA and GIS related researchers. We also want to show our work to the international society and attract more researcher to join us, letting them collaborate with us under this framework.</p>
<p>Before the conference, I expected to learn more about geometric algebra in various fields of research and introduce our achievement to everyone in order to attract more intelligent people to join us. And now, it works. From the perspective of geography at home and abroad, GA is high-profile in GIS because of the characteristics of GIS itself. There are a series of teams doing the research about it and there are some projects supporting it. Unfortunately, international geometric algebra teams are relatively dispersed. How to unite this group of people to form a complete organization is the key point to promote the development and influence of GA. The most important thing that I want to say is that international conference is important to publicize what we do and strengthen communication, publicity, and cooperation. That is what we have never done before.</p>
