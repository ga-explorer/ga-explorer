<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n <a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/index.php/2015/07/24/history-of-numbers1/">part one</a> of this functional history of numbers we saw the development of various number systems we are mostly familiar with. In this part, we will see the development of many number systems that are important for our modern scientific needs, geometrically and computationally. The sad fact about these developments is that we are using and teaching less effective number systems today because of a &#8220;series of unfortunate events&#8221; that took place during the grand drama of human development of modern mathematics.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton">Sir William Rowan Hamilton</a> a renounced Irish physicist, astronomer, and mathematician had been interested in complex numbers for a long time. Motivated by the beautiful geometric properties of complex numbers, he was obsessed with generalizing complex numbers to 3 dimensional space while keeping the most fascinating property of complex numbers: the unification of points (data) and transformations (processing) in a single algebraic entity while applying the transformations to points using algebraic multiplication and formal summation. Out of this preoccupation Hamilton was to invent the most beautiful algebra of the century: the algebra of quaternions. Hamilton never arrived at his beautiful generalization; it simply does not exist in the way he imagined. A fact about generalizations of abstract concepts is that they&#8217;re not free; with any generalization of a concept we must give up some of its properties. Often we cannot choose and control an arbitrary set of properties to generalize for some concept; this set may be consistent with the original concept but inconsistent with its generalization. Sadly enough, Hamilton and his followers made some big mistakes that almost banished quaternion algebra from practical applications in physics and engineering for a very long time<sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-270-1' id='enref-270-1' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(270)'>1</a></sup>. They literally missed the true beauty of quaternions as rotation operators<sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-270-2' id='enref-270-2' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(270)'>2</a></sup> in their stubborn pursuit of a specific form of beauty they imagined as pure mathematicians: a method to divide 3D vectors just like complex numbers. The full story of this unfortunate event can be found in Simon L. Altmann intriguing paper &#8220;Hamilton, Rodrigues, and the Quaternion Scandal&#8221;<sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-270-3' id='enref-270-3' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(270)'>3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>On the morning of Monday, 16 October 1843 Hamilton, accompanied by Lady Hamilton, was walking along the Royal Canal in Dublin towards the Royal Irish Academy, where Hamilton was to preside at a meeting. As he was walking past Broome Bridge (referred to as Brougham Bridge by Hamilton and called by this name ever since), Hamilton, in a flash of inspiration, realized that three, rather than two, imaginary units were needed in 3D space, with the properties <span class="wp-katex-eq" data-display="false">i^{2}=j^{2}=k^{2}=-1,\;ij=-k,\;ji=-k</span> and cyclic permutation. Hamilton carved these formulae on the stone of the bridge; poor Lady Hamilton had to wait. Armed now with four units, Hamilton called the number <span class="wp-katex-eq" data-display="false">A=a\,1+A_{x}\,i+A_{y}\,j+A_{z}\,k</span> where the coefficients here are all real, a quaternion. Hamilton made the product <span class="wp-katex-eq" data-display="false">ij=-ji</span> non-commutative. Not only was this the first time that a non-commutative product appeared in mathematics, but this was a true stroke of genius which has given us the last possible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_algebra#Associative_division_algebras">associative division algebra</a><sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-270-4' id='enref-270-4' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(270)'>4</a></sup>. As a complex number <span class="wp-katex-eq" data-display="false">C=x+iy</span> is the formal sum of a real part <span class="wp-katex-eq" data-display="false">x</span> and an imaginary part <span class="wp-katex-eq" data-display="false">iy</span>, a quaternion <span class="wp-katex-eq" data-display="false">Q_{A}=a\,1+A_{x}\,i+A_{y}\,j+A_{z}\,k</span> can be viewed as a formal sum of the real part <span class="wp-katex-eq" data-display="false">a</span> and the &#8220;pure-quaternion&#8221; part <span class="wp-katex-eq" data-display="false">A=A_{x}\,i+A_{y}\,j+A_{z}\,k</span>. It follows that the product of two quaternions <span class="wp-katex-eq" data-display="false">Q_{A}=a+A</span> and <span class="wp-katex-eq" data-display="false">Q_{B}=b+B</span> is given by: <span class="wp-katex-eq" data-display="false">Q_{A}Q_{B}=(ab-A\cdot B)+(aB+bA+A\times B)</span> where <span class="wp-katex-eq" data-display="false">A\cdot B=A_{x}B_{x}+A_{y}B_{y}+A_{z}B_{z}</span> and <span class="wp-katex-eq" data-display="false">A\times B=(A_{y}B_{z}-A_{z}B_{y})\,i+(A_{z}B_{x}-A_{x}B_{z})\,j+(A_{x}B_{y}-A_{y}B_{x})\,k</span></p>
<p>Although Hamilton did not give names or symbols for these operations, it is here that the scalar and vector products of two vectors appear for the first time in history. The big mistake Hamilton made was treating the pure-quaternion part as a vector (actually it&#8217;s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bivector#Quaternions">bivector</a>); he even named it a vector. He then treated rotations in 3D space using his newly invented algebra but with many internal contradictions stemming from his imagined goal of generalizing complex numbers while preserving all their &#8220;algebraically beautiful properties&#8221;. Two other unfortunate events happened in the drama of quaternions. First, Gauss had actually discovered quaternions but had never bothered to publish, as shown by Gauss&#8217;s notes from 1819, published in 1900; that certainly didn&#8217;t help Hamilton&#8217;s case. Second, a treatment of rotations and quaternions had been going on for some years before 1843, quite independently of Hamilton and taking a diametrically opposed view to his. This treatment was entirely geometrical, and because it tried to do a simple job in a simple way it was clear and precise and it was entirely successful, but it was largely ignored by everyone. It was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olinde_Rodrigues">Olinde Rodrigues</a> in his 1840 paper who provided a construction to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_rotation_theorem">Euler&#8217;s rotation theorem</a> correctly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Rodrigues_formula#Connection_with_quaternions">linking quaternions to rotations</a> <sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-270-5' id='enref-270-5' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(270)'>5</a></sup>. Hamilton himself geometrically rediscovered the results of the Rodrigues construction but completely ignored its importance; probably blinded by his original goal of &#8220;algebraic beauty&#8221;.</p>

<p>After Hamilton&#8217;s death, his work began to give fruits but not in the direction which he had expected. His ideas of vectors and of their scalar and vector products were much too important so that people began to try and graft a new skin onto them in order to make these concepts usable. Grassmann in Germany and Heaviside in Britain moved some way in this direction, but they were not much more transparent than Hamilton himself. It was left to Willard Gibbs of Yale to produce not only the first coherent picture of vectors and of their operations but also a good and successful working notation; effectively eliminating quaternions, with all their true beauty as rotation operators, from the picture. This hardened the response of Hamilton&#8217;s followers as one of them, Peter Tait, stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even Prof. Willard Gibbs must be ranked as one of the retarders of quaternion progress, in virtue of his pamphlet on Vector Analysis, a sort of hermaphrodite monster, compounded of the notations of Hamilton and of Grassmann.</p></blockquote>
<p>This was not the end of the story for quaternions. They would resurface many years later as advantageous rotation operators in 3D space; currently used in robotics, aviation, and computer graphics to name a few applications. Nevertheless, many important lessons can be taught from the story of the last division algebra. The main lesson being: you have to consistently follow the truth and it will lead to more beauty than the one you might imagine.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s said that necessity is the mother of invention; sometimes the lack of necessity brutally kills brilliant ideas. Linear algebra is a fascinating subject with applications in almost every field of science and engineering<sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-270-6' id='enref-270-6' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(270)'>6</a></sup>. When you search for a definition for the term &#8220;Linear Algebra&#8221; you will find a definition like:</p>
<blockquote><p>Linear Algebra is a branch of mathematics that is concerned with mathematical structures closed under the operations of addition and scalar multiplication and that includes the theory of systems of linear equations, matrices, determinants, vector spaces, and linear transformations. &#8212; Merriam Webster <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/linear%20algebra">online dictionary.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>When you take a look at some books about the subject you will find two kinds of books. The first kind<sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-270-7' id='enref-270-7' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(270)'>7</a></sup> mostly deals with linear equations, coordinate vectors (i.e. tuples of numbers), matrices, and determinants; this may give the wrong impression that linear algebra is nothing more than the study of matrix algebra and coordinate vectors in Euclidean space. The second kind of books<sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-270-8' id='enref-270-8' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(270)'>8</a></sup> deals with an abstract concept of vectors and linear transformations defined axiomatically without giving any special importance to coordinates, and applicable to any metric space Euclidean or not. Now matrices are put to perspective as no more than computational and representational tools for the subject, not the subject itself. Historically<sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-270-9' id='enref-270-9' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(270)'>9</a></sup> the first use of linear equations of 2 and 3 unknowns date back to ancient Babylonians and Chinese. The modern study of systems of linear equations can be said to have originated with Leibniz, who in 1693 invented the notion of a determinant for this purpose. Following developments took place by Cramer, Euler, Gauss, Laplace, Cauchy, Weierstrass, Kronecker, Cayley, Frobenius, and many others. All such developments were based on applications from diverse fields of mathematics and physics; a sign of the necessity and universality of linear algebra. In 1848, J.J. Sylvester introduced the term “matrix”, the Latin word for womb and a word related to &#8220;mother&#8221;, as a name for an array of numbers. By the year 1880, many of the fundamental results of linear algebra had been established, but they were not considered as parts of a general theory. In particular, the fundamental notion of vector space, within which such a theory would be framed, was absent. Matrices and coordinate vectors, out of necessity, are at the core of the historical development of linear algebra and vector spaces. In our modern computational age, any software library dealing with linear algebra must have matrices and their computational algorithms as the main component. Every engineer in the world must have some idea about the Matrix Laboratory; <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html">MATLAB</a>.</p>

<p>One mathematician took a fundamentally different approach to linear algebra than all others hoping to approach Leibniz&#8217;s dream of a universal algebra that can deal directly and simply with geometric entities<sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-270-10' id='enref-270-10' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(270)'>10</a></sup>; he was Hermann Günther Grassmann. Many have written about the extraordinary role of Grassmann&#8217;s work in modern mathematics and physics including Roger Penrose<sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-270-11' id='enref-270-11' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(270)'>11</a></sup>, David Hestenes<sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-270-12' id='enref-270-12' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(270)'>12</a></sup>, and many others<sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-270-13' id='enref-270-13' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(270)'>13</a></sup>. Desmond Fearnley-Sander describes how Grassmann developed linear algebra by himself in <a href="https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/upload_library/22/Ford/DesmondFearnleySander.pdf">his paper</a> &#8220;Hermann Grassmann and the Creation of Linear Algebra&#8221;. From the beginning, Grassmann distinguished linear algebra, as a formal theory independent of any interpretation, from its application in geometry. Grassmann described the concept of vector space and developed the theory of linear independence in a way which is astonishingly similar to the presentation one finds in modern linear algebra texts. He defined the concepts of subspace, linear independence, span, dimension, join and meet of subspaces, and projections of elements onto subspaces. He proved the invariance of dimension under change of basis and obtained the formula for change of coordinates under change of basis. He defined elementary transformations of basis and showed that every change of basis is a product of elementaries. His work led Peano in 1888 to put down the formal definitions of linear algebra that was ignored for 30 years until 1920 when Hermann Weyl and others published formal definitions resulting in the widespread of linear algebra ever since. Few have come closer than Hermann Grassmann to creating, single-handedly, a new subject. In addition, the first fundamental investigation in multi-dimensional geometry was provided by Grassmann in 1844, in which affine geometry was developed not only for three-dimensional space but for multi-dimensional space also. That it was Grassmann who succeeded in establishing an articulated theory of multidimensional space seems to be due largely to the fact that Grassmann was not under the influence of other great mathematicians of his time, and to his predilection for philosophical generalizations<sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-270-14' id='enref-270-14' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(270)'>14</a></sup>. The following is an extract from the Foreword of &#8220;Die Ausdehnungslehre: Vollständig und in strenger Form bearbeitet&#8221; (The Theory of Extension, Thoroughly and Rigorously Treated) published by Grassmann in 1862:</p>
<blockquote><p>I remain completely confident that the labor I have expended on the science presented here and which has demanded a significant part of my life as well as the most strenuous application of my powers, will not be lost. It is true that I am aware that the form which I have given the science is imperfect and must be imperfect. But I know and feel obliged to state (though I run the risk of seeming arrogant) that even if this work should again remain unused for another seventeen years or even longer, without entering into the actual development of science, still that time will come when it will be brought forth from the dust of oblivion and when ideas now dormant will bring forth fruit. I know that if I also fail to gather around me (as I have until now desired in vain) a circle of scholars, whom I could fructify with these ideas, and whom I could stimulate to develop and enrich them further, yet there will come a time when these ideas, perhaps in a new form, will arise anew and will enter into a living communication with contemporary developments. For truth is eternal and divine and no phase of it &#8230; can pass without a trace; it remains in existence even if the cloth in which weak mortals dress it disintegrates into dust.</p></blockquote>
<p>Grassmann expected his ideas would be revived even if unused for 17 years or longer; it actually took a hundred years. At that time in the 19th century, Grassmann&#8217;s ideas (especially in geometry) were revolutionary; they were too advanced for the necessities of his age. Ironically, Grassmann was renowned in his day as a linguist but as a mathematician, he had poor notational skills. His ideas were great but his symbolic expression of them was awkward. Few mathematicians of his age acknowledged his brilliance. One of them was the English mathematician and philosopher William Kingdon Clifford. Clifford was the one who would give new form and meaning to Grassmann&#8217;s ideas.</p>
<h3>Lost and Found: Geometric Algebra</h3>
<blockquote><p>The further a mathematical theory is developed, the more harmoniously and uniformly does its construction proceed, and unsuspected relations are disclosed between hitherto separated branches of the science. &#8212; David Hilbert.</p></blockquote>

<p>Grassmann&#8217;s vectors and subspaces were not numbers in a way complex numbers and quaternions are. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_algebra">Grassmann algebra</a>, a finite set of n vectors, representing 1-dimensional subspaces analogous to lines passing through the origin of a coordinate system of the space, are combined using his exterior product to algebraically form entities representing all other subspaces of dimension 2 to n. Grassmann had no interest, however, in representing transformations that &#8220;rotate&#8221; a subspace into another of the same dimension; something all physical and engineering models require to stand and function. Hamilton had the correct algebra for rotating vectors in 3-dimensional space but no generalization to n-dimensional space was present. While Hamilton lost his way insisting on treating rotations in 3D with the algebra of quaternions using direct multiplications, the brilliant but short-lived English mathematician William Kingdon Clifford took the correct path of generalizing rotations to the n-dimensional spaces of Grassmann<sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-270-15' id='enref-270-15' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(270)'>15</a></sup>; the resulting beautiful mathematical abstraction was called <a href="https://slehar.wordpress.com/2014/03/18/clifford-algebra-a-visual-introduction/">Clifford Algebra</a>. Clifford successfully unified and generalized Hamilton&#8217;s quaternions and Grassmann&#8217;s vector spaces in a uniform manner that affected physics and science ever since. His motivation was to create an algebra that can act on strange but common objects in geometry and physics called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor">spinors</a>. A spinor is an abstraction of an object that reverses its direction when rotated by an odd number of full cycles in space; contrary to our common intuition about physical 3D objects. Clifford also wrote his report at Cambridge &#8220;On the Space-Theory of Matter&#8221;, published in 1876, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kingdon_Clifford#Premonition_of_relativity">anticipating Albert Einstein’s general relativity</a> by 40 years. Clifford&#8217;s contemporaries considered him acute and original, witty and warm. Felix Klein wrote, regarding Clifford,</p>
<blockquote><p>I recall him with particular pleasure, as a man who understood me thoroughly from the first and soon extended my research.</p></blockquote>
<p>Clifford was also working late into the night, he collapsed twice in two years from overworking, which may have led to his death at a young age; another unfortunate event for the development of his geometric numbers. Although Clifford recognized his algebra&#8217;s unique signiﬁcance as a representation of geometric concepts as conceived by Grassmann, mathematicians abstracted Clifford algebra from its geometric origins after his death and, for the better part of a century, it languished as a minor sub-discipline of mathematics; one more algebra among so many others<sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-270-16' id='enref-270-16' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(270)'>16</a></sup>.</p>

<p>In 1966 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hestenes">David Orlin Hestenes</a> published his book &#8220;Space-Time Algebra&#8221;, motivated by a set of lecture notes by Marcel Riesz later published in 1993; launching him along three main lines of research:</p>
<ol>
<li>A straightforward reformulation of classical physics in terms of Clifford&#8217;s geometric algebra producing the first comprehensive coordinate-free treatment of Newtonian mechanics,  including rotational dynamics as explained in his book &#8220;New Foundations for Classical Mechanics&#8221;, in addition to a similar reformulation of classical electrodynamics.</li>
<li>Reformulating the Dirac equation in terms of Geometric Algebra. This revealed a hidden geometric structure in quantum mechanics, including a  hitherto unrecognized geometric interpretation for the unit imaginary relating it unequivocally to electron spin.</li>
<li>To produce a self-contained system of mathematical tools sufficient for addressing any problem in physics without resorting to alternative mathematical formalisms; as explained in his book &#8220;Clifford Algebra to Geometric Calculus, A Unified Language for Mathematics and Physics&#8221;.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hestenes received <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hestenes#Awards_and_fellowships">several awards</a> related to his efforts in teaching physics using GA. As he describes his work in reviving Clifford and Grassmann&#8217;s work:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was consciously concerned with questions relating the structure of these mathematical systems to the structure of the physical world. One day Riesz’s notes appeared on the new-book shelf of the UCLA library. The impact on me was immediate and striking! By the time I was half way through the first chapter I was convinced that Clifford algebra was the key to unifying mathematical physics. During the next few years I worked out the framework for a fully geometric unification. The result was published in my book Space Time Algebra (1966). Fortunately, my book was widely distributed, and it helped me establish many fruitful contacts throughout the world in subsequent years. However, I believe its impact would have dissipated had I not followed it up with years of further research, lectures and publications. Also, I believe that the significance of Riesz’s notes would have remained unrecognized without the citation in my book, which eventually led to publication (in 1993). Though the book launched me on a program to unify mathematical physics, I refrained from proclaiming the product as a universal Geometric Algebra and Calculus until subsequent research convinced me that was fully justified. I was well aware that its roots were in the work of Grassmann, but it was not until the English translations of the Ausdehnungslehre by Lloyd Kannenberg that I realized how deep those roots were.</p></blockquote>
<p>Later on, Hestenes ideas in physics found their way into many computer science and engineering applications over the last 15 years. We are still at the beginning of the road to exploring this powerful abstract number system for our ever growing geometric dependent applications.</p>
<h3>GA&#8217;s Multivectors: The Spacious Number System</h3>
<blockquote><p>Physics is mathematical not because we know so much about the physical world, but because we know so little; it is only its mathematical properties that we can discover. &#8212; Bertrand Russell.</p></blockquote>
<p>A geometric algebra is constructed from a set of <span class="wp-katex-eq" data-display="false">n</span> basis vectors on a scalar field (for example real or complex numbers) and a symmetric bilinear form defining the metric (i.e. the scalar-valued inner product of pairs of basis vectors). Using Clifford&#8217;s geometric product a set of <span class="wp-katex-eq" data-display="false">2^{n}</span> basis blades, representing main subspaces of the algebra of dimensions 0 to <span class="wp-katex-eq" data-display="false">n</span>, are constructed. Multivectors, our geometric numbers, are linear combinations of the basis blades. All GA algebraic operations and beauty follow from this simple construction.</p>

<p>I will not go into the mathematical and geometric properties of GA in this post, after all, the whole site is dedicated to exploring GA, but I will mention some of its general characteristic strengths as an algebraic language for geometry compared to traditional matrix-based linear algebra for geometric modeling<sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-270-17' id='enref-270-17' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(270)'>17</a></sup>:</p>
<p>1. GA can be used to model many geometries including non-Euclidean ones. The same algebraic structure can have many geometric modeling interpretations<sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-270-18' id='enref-270-18' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(270)'>18</a></sup>.</p>
<div id="attachment_419" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ga-spaces.png" data-rel="lightbox-11" title=""><img class="wp-image-419 size-medium" src="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ga-spaces-300x227.png" alt="ga-spaces" width="300" height="227" srcset="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ga-spaces-300x227.png 300w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ga-spaces.png 474w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">GA can be used to study non-Euclidean Geometries (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1101.4542v3.pdf">Source</a>)</p></div>
<p>2. Many familiar algebraic entities can be considered isomorphic to special cases of multivectors. These include real numbers, complex numbers, quaternions, and vectors of many types (position, direction, and normal vectors), Many types of matrices, typically used as linear transforms, can be replaced by GA multivectors including orthogonal matrices, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_matrices">Pauli matrices</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates">homogeneous transform matrices</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_411" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ga-3d-rotation.png" data-rel="lightbox-12" title=""><img class="wp-image-411 size-medium" src="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ga-3d-rotation-300x236.png" alt="ga-3d-rotation" width="300" height="236" srcset="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ga-3d-rotation-300x236.png 300w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ga-3d-rotation.png 560w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Quaternions as GA versors (<a href="http://geometricalgebra.net/figures.html">Source</a>)</p></div>
<p>3. Grassmann&#8217;s outer product can be used inside GA to construct algebraic entities called blades, one type of multivectors, that represent subspaces of the base vector space. Depending on the selected geometric model for the vectors, blades will be a systematic representation of geometric primitives inside the selected geometry.</p>
<div id="attachment_423" style="width: 271px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ga-blades-geometry.png" data-rel="lightbox-13" title=""><img class="wp-image-423 size-medium" src="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ga-blades-geometry-261x300.png" alt="ga-blades-geometry" width="261" height="300" srcset="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ga-blades-geometry-261x300.png 261w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ga-blades-geometry.png 579w" sizes="(max-width: 261px) 100vw, 261px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The same GA blade (subspace) can have several geometric interpretations (<a href="http://www2.ic.uff.br/~laffernandes/projects/ga/2009_SIBGRAPI_tutorial/fernandes_oliveia_SIBGRAPI_2009_tutorial_slides.pdf">Source</a>)</p></div>
<p>4. Linear transformations on the base vector space can be easily extended and directly applied to blades (subspaces) using what is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outermorphism">outermorphisms</a>. Now we can algebraically manipulate the geometric primitives of our selected geometry by linear transformations without the use of matrices if we want.</p>
<p>5. Orthogonal transformations (linear transformations consisting of a series of reflections on hyperplanes) are very important for many geometric applications. GA can efficiently represent and apply such transformations using a special kind of multivectors called a versor. This is a very good alternative for orthogonal matrices both theoretically and computationally in many situations.</p>
<div id="attachment_410" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ga-3d-reflection.png" data-rel="lightbox-14" title=""><img class="wp-image-410 size-medium" src="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ga-3d-reflection-300x226.png" alt="ga-3d-reflection" width="300" height="226" srcset="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ga-3d-reflection-300x226.png 300w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ga-3d-reflection.png 530w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">In GA, versors come from using vectors as reflection operators; all orthogonal transformations are series of reflections (<a href="http://geometricalgebra.net/figures.html">Source</a>)</p></div>
<p>6. Verosrs can be applied to geometric constructions in a &#8220;covariant&#8221; manner. In traditional matrix algebra, we need to analyze a subspace, representing some geometric entity, to its vector components before applying the orthogonal transform then reconstruct the transformed subspace\entity from the transformed vectors. In GA we can directly apply orthogonal transforms to geometric entities using versors and blades with no need for any extra overhead.</p>
<p>7. In GA many blades can act as versors, leading to the use of geometric entities as orthogonal transformations. One can, say, rotate a plane and reflect a circle on the rotated plane using the same multivectors with no conversion to any other algebraic representations. This is a very different concept, and indeed a very powerful one, compared to the traditional matrix algebra approach.</p>

<p>8. In some cases, GA can be used to find closed form expressions for geometric interpolations and perturbations of non-trivial kinds. This would very much help in developing algorithms for important geometric models.</p>
<div id="attachment_429" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/isea_img2_01_flat2.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-16" title=""><img class="wp-image-429 size-medium" src="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/isea_img2_01_flat2-300x146.jpg" alt="isea_img2_01_flat2" width="300" height="146" srcset="http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/isea_img2_01_flat2-300x146.jpg 300w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/isea_img2_01_flat2-768x373.jpg 768w, http://ga-explorer.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/isea_img2_01_flat2-1024x497.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">GA interpolations of motion using versors (<a href="http://isea2011.sabanciuniv.edu/paper/versor-proposal-system-organic-constructivism">Source</a>)</p></div>
<p>9. GA can work well with traditional matrix-based modeling techniques. One can use a linear algebra software library and interface it with a GA model easily; no need to model everything into GA from scratch.</p>
<p>10. All the above and other GA characteristics can make life much easier for people creating computational code for geometric modeling applications. GA is consistent and systematic algebraically with direct geometric interpretation. You just need to select your model and do the math; programming is straight forward. For example take a look at <a href="https://vimeo.com/wolftype">these videos</a> created using the <a href="http://versor.mat.ucsb.edu">Versor GA library</a>.</p>
<p>All these unique characteristics will certainly have deep influence, over the long run, on our understanding and development of geometric models in science and engineering. Many problems related to practical use and teaching of GA remain to be solved, but the concept had already been proven and the way is now much more clear for many researchers. In our next and final part of this functional history of numbers we will investigate another kind of numbers; the numbers we use in computing everything.</p>

<blockquote><p>If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is &#8211; John von Neumann</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>bstraction is a fundamental human skill and tool for understanding the universe. If you&#8217;re an artist expressing emotions and visual experiences, if you&#8217;re a mathematician investigating theorems and proofs, if you&#8217;re an engineer designing models and performing simulations, if you&#8217;re a software developer creating code for software systems, or if you&#8217;re an educator in need for transferring knowledge and motivating skills you must use abstraction to &#8220;create and communicate&#8221;. In one book about abstraction <sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-130-1' id='enref-130-1' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(130)'>1</a></sup> the following definition is adopted:</p>
<blockquote><p>abstraction is deﬁned as &#8220;the process of extracting the underlying essence of a mathematical concept, removing any dependence on real world objects with which it might originally have been connected, and generalizing it so that it has wider applications.&#8221; A good illustrative example of this abstraction process is geometry, which started from the observation and measurement of physical spaces and forms, moving then to the abstract axioms of the Euclidean geometry, and, later on, to non-Euclidean geometries, farther and farther removed from the perceived physical world. An interesting aspect of abstraction is that an increase in the level of abstraction is paralleled by a deepening in the understanding of the connections among mathematical concepts. For instance, by abstracting the Non-Euclidean geometry to “the study of properties invariant under a given group of symmetries” has revealed deep connections between geometry and abstract algebra. Moreover, abstraction can suggest direction of knowledge transfer among different domains.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve been dealing with mathematical abstractions most of my life, as a student then as a software engineer and faculty member, on various levels and forms. My experience is like trying to find a safe path in a big forest of data and ideas that keep on growing and changing each day. Abstractions are like trees in the big forest; some are very tall and hard to climb but if you could reach their top you uncover vast areas of ideas and directions and you may even gain some wisdom about life itself. Some other abstractions are so weak and short-lived they just keep you warm at night or perhaps you can make a rope to climb the other tall trees of abstraction the next morning. Some abstractions are elegant and beautiful but may bare little fruit for quite some time (practical applications). Some abstractions are ugly but many depend on them for their practical usefulness. It also may happen that strong useful trees of abstraction can hide taller and better ones from our &#8220;mental vision&#8221; and at some point we have to either jump from them or completely cut them down from our minds to get higher. Finding a safe path inside such forest is a blessing not all are granted. Worse yet you could find your safe path and walk it alone as no other sees its elegance, usefulness, and security except you. Then you would have to call for company by creating a website like this one.</p>
<p>Writing your first computer code at 11 and continuing to write more code for 25 or more years gives you many joys, disappointments, questions, ideas, and ultimately more knowledge. From an early stage you realize that mathematics is both a fuel and limit for your computing skills. The more efficient your mathematical abstractions are the more powerful ideas you have, the more you can realize in your code, and the more wisdom you gain. This intuition was emphasized in my engineering study and practice through the universal presence of mathematics in computer science books and articles more than any other engineering discipline. Searching for and using good mathematical abstractions is, in my opinion, an important task for anyone in my position.</p>
<h3>The Linear Engineer</h3>
<p>Up to high school one gets usually familiar with some useful but &#8220;apparently distinct&#8221; mathematical abstractions. Several number systems (typically natural, rational, real, and complex numbers) are introduced. Polynomial algebra on real numbers is studied. Euclidean geometry in 2D and 3D (usually started by trigonometry and some analytic geometry) is presented. And some calculus is used to link the physical world to the mathematical world <sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-130-2' id='enref-130-2' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(130)'>2</a></sup>. Each of these abstractions are usually taught as sets of &#8220;mathematical recipes&#8221; that are barely related together by any common thread of thought. This method of teaching is very annoying, and ultimately limiting, to &#8220;deep thinkers&#8221; on both sides: teachers and students.</p>
<p>The first shock usually comes in the &#8220;higher education&#8221; at the university. One would expect that the sets of &#8220;mathematical recipes&#8221; would somehow merge into a set of smaller, more powerful and seamlessly integrating mathematical abstractions to suit the needs of engineers and scientists. Instead I found myself lost in a larger, more divided forest of &#8220;mathematical tools&#8221; rather than the well designed &#8220;garden of abstract knowledge&#8221; that I expected to enter in my engineering study. <span class="pullquote-right">Instead I found myself lost in a larger, more divided forest of &#8220;mathematical tools&#8221; rather than the well designed &#8220;garden of abstract knowledge&#8221; that I expected to enter in my engineering study.</span></p>
<p>During my first year <sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-130-3' id='enref-130-3' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(130)'>3</a></sup> I found the first step to my path, a.k.a Abstract Linear Algebra <sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-130-4' id='enref-130-4' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(130)'>4</a></sup>. I was blessed to be taught this course by Dr. Muhammad Yossuf <sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-130-5' id='enref-130-5' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(130)'>5</a></sup> who had us view vectors and linear transforms as the elegant abstractions of Euclidean directions, positions, and motions, but with richer, deeper meanings and wider applicability by treating matrices as &#8220;convenient computational tools&#8221; rather than &#8220;mindless mathematical recipes&#8221;. This was my first time to climb a big abstraction tree and see the heavens and earth from higher grounds. The power of this concept of &#8220;linear abstraction&#8221; enabled me to view hidden links between seemingly diverse subjects of study in later years (like automatic control, differential equations, numerical analysis, and signal processing for example). Now I could invent new &#8220;mathematical recipes&#8221; and cook them into large amounts of computer code without losing insight into the basic idea behind the code. And once you find such path it&#8217;s impossible to go back.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not strange that linear algebra is very important to engineers in all fields <sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-130-6' id='enref-130-6' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(130)'>6</a></sup>. For example the following statement taken from one signal processing book <sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-130-7' id='enref-130-7' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(130)'>7</a></sup> can be found in many engineering books in some form or another:</p>
<blockquote><p>Much information is available for both the analysis and design of LTI (linear time-invariant) systems. This is especially true for system design. In fact, in preliminary design stages for non-LTI physical systems, we often fit a LTI model to the physical system so as to have a starting point for the design. The LTI model may not be very accurate, but the use of an LTI model allows us to initiate the design process with standard design procedures.</p></blockquote>
<p>I discovered after graduation, as my second shock, that the universe is mostly non-linear, that there is noting that can be time-invariant because of the second law of thermodynamics, and that most systems are very sensitive to initial conditions to be predictable for indefinite periods of time (as clearly stated by chaos theory and widely experienced in practice). Nevertheless, a linear system is a good starting point to model and solve almost all problems in engineering; mostly because many engineers are afraid of the darkness of the mathematics of non-linear chaotic systems, a very dark part of the mathematical forest of abstractions.</p>
<h3>The Geometric Engineer</h3>
<p>In Arabic the word engineering is pronounced &#8220;Handasah&#8221; and is said to be of Persian origin meaning &#8220;the ability to solve problems&#8221;. The word geometry is also called &#8220;Handasah&#8221; in Arabic; definitely not a coincidence. Since the dawn of human civilization geometry and engineering were the same. It appears that the need for regulating water supply and creating landmark buildings in the ancient world along with the in-built ability of the human brain to reason in 3D space was the origin of all engineering. Engineers can never understand, model, create, or maintain any technology without using a geometry of some sort. The natural way of expressing and understanding geometry is to draw elegant diagrams that made us proud in our first years as engineering students while taking care of drawing each line and writing every dimension. <span class="pullquote-right">The natural way of expressing and understanding geometry is to draw elegant diagrams that made us proud in our first years as engineering students while taking care of drawing each line and writing every dimension.</span> Although lines and planes are common in many engineering designs, they are not the only objects; not even the most important ones. Spheres, cylinders, cones, and many more complex non-linear objects are known and have been used through history.</p>
<p>Throughout history the main efforts to further our understanding and use of geometry have always been through algebra. From the very old theory of Pythagoras, through the vast advancements of algebra, trigonometry, and geometry by Muslim mathematicians <sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-130-8' id='enref-130-8' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(130)'>8</a></sup>, to the modern view of Cayley–Klein geometry <sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-130-9' id='enref-130-9' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(130)'>9</a></sup>, the struggle was to find algebraic abstractions to express geometric ideas. Currently we have many such algebraic abstractions (too many in fact); the problem now is not to find such abstractions, but how to teach them to whom it may concern!</p>
<h3>The Computational Engineer</h3>
<p>To create software based on geometric abstractions it&#8217;s impossible to &#8220;directly&#8221; explain yourself to a computer through the human method of diagrams and verbal explanations. One must use algebra, expressed as data structures and algorithms, to &#8220;generate&#8221; the code that implements the intended geometric knowledge. Even software systems with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) like AutoCAD and 3ds Max use algebra-based data structures and algorithms internally. The GUI is just a layer for our human convenience not for any intrinsic need of the computer itself <sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-130-10' id='enref-130-10' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(130)'>10</a></sup>. In our study as engineers the use of vector algebra and vector calculus is dominant. Any software library dealing with geometry must have matrices and vectors built into its core. My third &#8220;shock of abstraction&#8221; that happened after completing my M.Sc. was to find this use not motivated by the lack of better algebraic systems, but rather by a &#8220;series of unfortunate events!&#8221; <sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-130-11' id='enref-130-11' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(130)'>11</a></sup>. <span class="pullquote-right">My third &#8220;shock of abstraction&#8221; that happened after completing my M.Sc. was to find this use not motivated by the lack of better algebraic systems, but rather by a &#8220;series of unfortunate events!&#8221;</span> In addition, not all problems that can be described mathematically can be computed. The set of problems that we can &#8220;theoretically&#8221; compute solutions for is closely linked to the existence of an algorithm to solve the problem. Even in that theoretical set of computable problems we need to find an algorithm that produces acceptable results in &#8220;reasonable&#8221; time, hardware, and input-size requirements (remember the big O notation). One other problem is to find a programming language that &#8220;suits&#8221; the algorithm we found. The code should be writable, readable, and in general beautiful code <sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-130-12' id='enref-130-12' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(130)'>12</a></sup>. The first two problems are the hardest theoretically; the third is the hardest practically.</p>
<p>There are two main kinds of programming languages: the general and the specific. General purpose programming languages are dominant in creating geometric-algebraic solutions to our problems. Everybody knows C++, Java, C#, Python, or some other such language. But generality comes with many problems in readability, writablity, and elegance of written code. In addition creating code by a general purpose programming language usually separates the designer of the algorithm from the developer of the code. If the &#8220;geometric modeller&#8221; tries to write the code himself, as he should, using a general purpose language all kinds of problems often occur including memory leaks, bad performance, and having to learn the full details of a whole language just to create an efficient implementation of a required algorithm. Object oriented programming may solve some of these problems, but a good tool to implement computational software should contain a domain specific language (DSL)<sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-130-13' id='enref-130-13' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(130)'>13</a></sup> that can be used directly by the &#8220;domain expert&#8221; to write code that can be translated automatically to machine code or to a general purpose language code as an intermediate stage of compilation.</p>
<h3>The Pedagogical Engineer</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogy" target="_blank">Pedagogy</a> is the discipline that deals with the theory and practice of education; it thus concerns the study and practice of how best to teach. A good teacher is always on the search for better ways to transfer knowledge and skills to students. The most important skill to be transferred to engineering students is the ability to self-educate. Dealing with new technology every day, especially in computer science, is impossible without such vital skill. But all engineering is based on mathematical abstractions; especially the algebraic, geometric, and computational abstractions. The nature of many mathematical abstractions used in teaching is, in my own experience as an engineering student and teacher, the most limiting for motivating and transferring the skill of self-education. The same conceptually intuitive geometric abstraction is expressed using too many algebraic tools. Let&#8217;s take the simple concept of &#8220;rotation&#8221; as an example. Rotation is so geometrically basic that we deal with it easily in childhood; as individual children and as early human collective knowledge. Then we are taught to express rotations in the plane using trigonometry, After some time we use orthogonal matrices for the same purpose in 2D and 3D. If we take a course in electrical circuits we discover that electrical engineers deal with constant frequency &#8220;rotating vectors&#8221; in the form of exponential functions. If we use some computer graphics library like DirectX we use something called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion" target="_blank">quaternion</a> to perform rotation in 3D space. The simple concept of rotation is expressed using too many algebraic abstractions with no apparent connection and no easy way of deciding when to use each tool and how to convert the geometric data to suit that algebraic tool. The direct result of such problem is a limited number of geometrically competent engineers; a very frustrating outcome for many teachers and students alike. Another consequence is the need for many teaching hours per subject to establish a mathematical base of algebraic tools specific to that subject <sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-130-14' id='enref-130-14' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(130)'>14</a></sup>. If there were a single abstract framework to be taught once for most subjects that would make more time for teaching the engineering concepts rather than the mathematical tools. The current state of affairs in engineering teaching is a lack of such a unifying framework; after all, abstraction is about unification through extraction of common patterns.</p>
<h3>Geometric Algebra Computing</h3>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to be linear engineers; to find linear approximations for non-linear systems and create models accordingly.</li>
<li>We need to be geometric engineers; to think geometrically about our models and express our ideas algebraically.</li>
<li>We need to be computational engineers; to develop algorithms and implement them, at least partially, using domain specific languages suitable for our needs.</li>
<li>We need to be pedagogical engineers; to find a unifying mathematical abstraction suitable for building engineering skills in ourselves and our students in the most efficient manner.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key point here is &#8220;algebraic abstraction&#8221;. We need to find some compact mathematical algebraic abstraction, superseding the common ones, that directly corresponds to our human geometric intuition. This abstraction should be general enough to express and generalize familiar abstractions (like complex numbers, quaternions, subspace operations, linear transformations, and more) using a unified framework of algebraic tools. Now we can think geometrically and directly express our algorithms using a uniform algebraic framework and interpret the results efficiently. Creating a simple DSL based on such abstraction would be much easier as a great step in unifying computational geometry. Teaching geometry using such algebraic and programmatic tools would be efficient, fulfilling, and much more productive to students and teachers.</p>
<p>The reason this website is mainly dedicated to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_algebra">Geometric Algebra</a> is that it has the potential of being <strong><em>the</em></strong> algebraic abstraction system for geometric processing for this century, just as vector algebra was for the 20th century. My goal isn&#8217;t to add to the mathematics behind GA, that&#8217;s already been done quite sufficiently, but rather to illustrate, reformulate, explore, and implement solutions to common problems in engineering and computer science in the abstract language of GA. That step has already been taken in physics with remarkable success. It&#8217;s about time to do the same on a wide scale in engineering and computer science. The title of this site &#8220;Geometric Algebra Computing&#8221; may have several meanings associated with it. One such meaning is given by <strong>Dr. Dietmar Hildenbrand</strong> (<a href="http://www.gaalop.de/dhilden/">http://www.gaalop.de/dhilden/</a>) the author of the book &#8220;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Foundations-Geometric-Algebra-Computing-Geometry/dp/3642317936/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1431672092&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=dietmar+hildenbrand/">Foundations of Geometric Algebra Computing</a>&#8221; and creator of &#8220;<a href="http://www.gaalop.de/">Geometric Algebra Algorithms Optimizer (Gaalop)</a>&#8221; software. In his book, he defines <em><strong>“Geometric Algebra Computing”</strong></em> as:</p>
<blockquote><p>The geometrically intuitive development of algorithms using geometric algebra with a focus on their efficient implementation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Personally, I think about Geometric Algebra as a way of <em><strong>symbolic geometric thinking</strong></em>, not just another algebraic system. Computers can only be programmed when we fully understand the abstractions and processes involved in the problem at hand. Computing with Geometric Algebra is fascinating because it&#8217;s a high-level language for geometry as we humans think and understand and, at the same time, a logical algebraic system suitable for being a universal base for creating computer code for geometric processing using current compiler technology. Most of my research efforts are dedicated to illustrating and realizing the full potential of GA in various scientific computing applications.</p>
<p>I hope this site is successful in illustrating the power of GA-based linear models and DSLs. I hope you find your own path in the great forest of mathematical abstractions enjoyable and maturing.</p>
