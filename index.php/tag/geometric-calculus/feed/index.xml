<p><a href="http://faculty.luther.edu/~macdonal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Alan Macdonald</a> is Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at Luther College in Decorah Iowa. He received a Ph.D. in mathematics from The University of Michigan in 1970. His research interests include geometric algebra and the foundations of physics.</p>
<p>Dr. Alan is the author of two excellent books that introduce Geometric Algebra and Geometric Calculus to undergraduate students. In his first book <a href="http://faculty.luther.edu/~macdonal/laga/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Linear and Geometric Algebra</strong></em></a>, he develops the first undergraduate text to cover the essentials of linear algebra and its extension to geometric algebra. Prof. David Hestenes commented on his first book saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>I commend Alan Macdonald for his excellent book! His exposition is clean and spare. He has done a fine job of engineering a gradual transition from standard views of linear algebra to the perspective of geometric algebra. The book is sufficiently conventional to be adopted as a textbook by an adventurous teacher without getting flack from colleagues. Yet it leads to gems of geometric algebra that are likely to delight thoughtful students and surprise even the most experienced instructors.</p></blockquote>
<p>His second book <a href="http://faculty.luther.edu/~macdonal/vagc/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Vector and Geometric Calculus</strong></em></a> distinguishes itself from similar books on advanced calculus by two attributes: its thoroughgoing use of Geometric Algebra and the clarity of its exposition at an undergraduate level.</p>

<p>I read strong claims about geometric algebra and decided to look for myself. I was smitten. I found that geometric algebra and its extension to geometric calculus unify, simplify, and generalize vast areas of mathematics involving geometric ideas, including linear algebra, vector calculus, complex analysis, exterior algebra and calculus, tensor algebra and calculus, quaternions (3D spinors), and euclidean, non-euclidean, and projective geometries. I also found that GA provides a common mathematical language for many areas of physics (classical and quantum mechanics, electrodynamics, special and general relativity), computer science (graphics, robotics, computer vision), engineering, and other fields. People in disparate fields can now talk to each other!</p>

<p>My response: <em><strong>Geometric algebra unifies many of your mathematical tools and works better than any of them</strong>.</em> Unfortunately, this has not been sufficient to induce many to switch. GA takes time to learn. And once learned, there is the problem of communicating with others who haven&#8217;t learned. Nevertheless, geometric algebra is gaining adherents, slowly but surely.</p>

<p>Geometric algebra is a superset of linear algebra, with more objects, multivectors, and more operations; for example, the geometric product. So anything that linear algebra can do geometric algebra can do. Even within linear algebra, geometric algebra brings advantages. Here is a simple example. Consider the orthogonal complement of a subspace: the set of vectors orthogonal to all vectors in the subspace. For both linear and geometric algebra this <strong><em>geometric</em> </strong>definition tells us what the orthogonal complement <strong><em>is</em></strong>. Geometric algebra adds algebra, providing a very simple way to <strong><em>compute</em> </strong>the complement (as a dual), something linear algebra can&#8217;t do. This illustrates the name <em><strong>Geometric Algebra</strong></em>: it does geometry algebraically.</p>

<p>I share David Hestenes&#8217; vision of wide acceptance of GA and the advantages this will bring.</p>
<p>A vital aspect of making this happen is encouraging and enabling GA&#8217;s inclusion in the undergraduate mathematics curriculum. The only way that mathematics faculties will consider this is to have available GA texts written in traditional mathematics textbook style. This is my small contribution to Hestenes&#8217; vision.</p>
<p>Mathematicians have been infuriatingly slow in becoming interested in geometric algebra. We are repeating the short-sightedness of 120 years ago when <em><strong>Engineers welcomed Gibbs&#8217;s and Heaviside&#8217;s vector analysis, though the mathematicians did not</strong> </em><sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-2731-1' id='enref-2731-1' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(2731)'>1</a></sup>.</p>

But it is far from everything I could ask for: its syntax for expressions is sometimes awkward; it requires several other programs, e.g., Python, making installation difficult for some; and it has no graphics capability.</p>
<p>I would like to see a program with GAlgebra&#8217;s strengths but not its shortcomings.</p>

<p>My experience is in teaching undergraduate mathematics in the United States, so I will speak to that. Students typically take a year of scalar calculus in their first year of college, then courses in linear algebra and vector calculus in their second year.</p>
<p>The most natural place to introduce GA &amp; GC is right after scalar calculus. I believe that the current second-year linear algebra and vector calculus courses should be renamed <em>Geometric Algebra</em> and <em>Geometric Calculus</em>, their purpose being to provide the basic vocabulary of mathematics in dimensions greater than one. By judiciously trimming the current courses and taking advantage of the simplifications of GA &amp; GC, a lot of GA &amp; GC can be covered. My two textbooks <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Geometric-Algebra-Alan-Macdonald/dp/1453854932" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Linear and Geometric Algebra</em></a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Geometric-Calculus-Alan-Macdonald/dp/1480132454/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=1480132454&amp;pd_rd_r=YMSWSBWDXT255WXMRTN6&amp;pd_rd_w=PZx9C&amp;pd_rd_wg=p6xhV&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=YMSWSBWDXT255WXMRTN6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Vector and Geometric Calculus</em></a> are attempts at this.</p>

<p>GA &amp; GC are well developed at the elementary level, ready for use. But there are problems to be solved before they can take their rightful place.</p>
<p>We face a chicken and egg problem: students must learn GA &amp; GC to apply them, and those applying vector methods, but not brought up on GA &amp; GC, must push for their inclusion in the curriculum. And if students learn GA &amp; GC in their second year, this cannot be a dead end: instructors in later courses must use them in their courses. Another problem: people are reluctant to publish using a mathematical formalism unknown to most. We can only do our best, making incremental progress until a critical mass is achieved.</p>

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/me.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2338" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/me.png" alt="Dr. Garret Sobczyk" width="230" height="384" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/me.png 230w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/me-180x300.png 180w" sizes="(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px" /></a>Dr. Garret Sobczyk is Emeritus Professor of Mathematics, Universidad de las Americas-Puebla, Mexico. Dr. Sobczyk first learned about Clifford geometric algebras from Prof. David Hestenes as a graduate student in mathematics at Arizona State University in 1966. He became convinced early on that geometric algebra is rightly considered to be the completion of the real number system to include the concept of direction. He obtained his Ph.D. in mathematics in 1971 and eagerly set forth to convince the world. This quest led him to spend 5 years in Poland as a postdoctoral student at the Institute of Theoretical Physics in Wroclaw, before returning to the United States in 1983. He coauthored with Prof. David Hestenes the book, “Clifford Algebra to Geometric Calculus: A Unified Language for Mathematics and Physics”, published in 1985. He held several academic positions in the United States and Mexico, before settling with his Polish wife Wanda at the Universidad de Las Americas in Cholula, Mexico in 1993. He has published over 30 articles exploring the close relationships between geometric algebra and linear and multilinear algebra and other topics and is a member of Sistema Nacional de Investigadores de Mexico.</p>

<h3>The Fellowship of Founders</h3>
<p><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Tell us about your early work with Dr. David Hestenes. What made you decide to work with him on the development of Geometric Algebra (GA) and Geometric Calculus (GC)?</strong></span></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/World-Line.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2345" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/World-Line-293x300.jpg" alt="World-Line" width="293" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/World-Line-293x300.jpg 293w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/World-Line.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 293px) 100vw, 293px" /></a>Thank you, Ahmad, for giving me the opportunity to share with you some of my early memories as a graduate student at Arizona State University (ASU) working in geometric algebra.</p>
<p>It was in 1965 when I had just completed my Master’s Degree in Mathematics and was looking for direction to continue my studies for a Ph.D. that I decided to explore possibilities in mathematical physics. Professor David Hestenes, a new professor at ASU, was offering a course in electrodynamics that caught my attention. On the first day of class, he began by introducing Geometric Algebra (GA) and the geometric product of vectors. I was amazed that I had never heard of the concept of a bivector as a directed area, or of the geometric product of vectors. It was over the course of that year that I decided that I wanted to dedicate my efforts for my Ph.D. into developing GA as a basic language in mathematics that I believed it to be then, and still do now a half a century later!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>I suspect it wasn&#8217;t easy for you to learn and apply Geometric Algebra back then. What did you do?</strong></span></p>
<p>Indeed, I did not have an easy beginning. David, at first suggested topics in Kellogg’s Potential Theory and Harmonic Analysis or generalizing Elliptic Functions. All of these were very good topics which have been extensively developed by European groups such as the Delanghe-Sommen group in Belgium, and others, but I was unable to make any real progress in these areas. It was at this point, almost in desperation, that I started to look at very basic ideas in linear algebra and differential geometry. Surely, if GA was indeed a basic language (over the continual skepticism of my Father; then a Professor of Mathematics at Clemson University, with a Ph.D. from Princeton University when he was a 23 year old), GA should offer new insights in these basic fields. Even to this day, most mathematicians believe that trying to reformulate differential geometry in GA is only putting old wine in new bottles.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Killing-vector-s2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2346" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Killing-vector-s2-300x240.jpg" alt="Killing-vector-s2" width="300" height="240" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Killing-vector-s2-300x240.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Killing-vector-s2.jpg 512w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>I undertook a serious study of linear and multilinear algebra out of books by Gel’fand, Shilov, and Greub, and basic differential geometry. I was also greatly influenced by books such as “Science Awakening” by van der Waerden, Tobias Dantzig’s book, “Number The Language of Science”, Wilder’s “Evolution of Mathematical Concepts”, and Michael Crowe’s “History of Vector Analysis”. I considered my first “breakthrough” in linear algebra to be when I discovered how to derive the Cayley-Hamilton theorem in GA by first looking at the simplest 2-dimensional case. I spent a great deal of time developing the notion of the vector and simplicial derivatives in GA as a basic tool in linear algebra. Almost all of my 1971 Ph.D. thesis consisted of a systematic development of the general simplicial derivative as a basic tool in linear algebra.</p>
<p>It was only toward the end of my thesis that I was able to start making progress in laying down the basic ideas of Riemannian Curvature in differential geometry, material which David and I developed further over a period of four years afterwards, and would later make up the heart of our book “Clifford Algebra to Geometric Calculus: A Unified Language for Mathematics and Physics”, which wasn’t published until a decade later in 1984.</p>

<h3>Facing the Real World</h3>
<p><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Tell us about your steps after finishing your Ph.D. Were you able to easily get recognition for your groundbreaking work with Prof. Hestenes?</strong></span></p>
<p>After finishing my Ph.D. at ASU in 1971, I was unsuccessful in obtaining any academic position. The first academic job crunch was on and for every teaching position at a University or College there were hundreds of applicants, and Mathematics Departments to which I applied were suspicious of me working in an unknown area and with a young theoretical physicist as my thesis adviser. Fortunately, ASU kept me on for an additional year as a Visiting Assistant Professor, which gave us the chance to continue working closely together in developing GA. At first, we planned on publishing four papers, which later formed the basis of our book. The following year, I was still unsuccessful in obtaining any academic position.</p>
<p>At first, I visited a number of American University Mathematics Departments with well-known people in differential geometry, but none were interested in GA or in my work. I also realized that my basic knowledge of differential geometry was insufficient to convince anyone of any need to reformulate it in a new language. In 1973, I visited European Universities in different countries and was invited to give a number of talks about GA, but it was only in Poland that I was offered a Research Fellowship with the Polish Academy of Sciences, which allowed me to continue to develop basic tools in GA that eventually went into our book CA to GC in 1984. I returned to Poland in 1976 with a Postdoctoral Research Grant from Stoney Brook University in NY, allowing me to continue my work with new colleagues at the Institute of Theoretical Physics in Wroclaw until 1980.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Were you able to use your knowledge of GA in teaching? How did you manage that in the following years?</strong></span></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/CA2GC.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-2347 size-medium" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/CA2GC-200x300.jpg" alt="Clifford Algebra to Geometric Calculus" width="200" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/CA2GC-200x300.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/CA2GC.jpg 333w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a>I enjoyed two academic appointments as an Assistant and Associate professor of Mathematics at Spring Hill College, Mobile, Ala., and at Lander College, Greenwood, SC in the 1980’s, and began developing material to teach undergraduate students GA and calculus. Finally, in 1984, our book CA to GC was published, which provided a needed boost to my career, but even to this day, the book has been largely ignored by the majority of the Mathematics Community.</p>
<p>It was difficult to teach GA and GC to students at this level because it usually takes a full year to get students comfortable with GA, and an undergraduate student is expected to master many other subjects as well. As my Finnish friend and colleague, the late Professor Pertti Lounesto remarked, about the best you can do is “smuggled it in” under the guise of closely related material, such as vector analysis and differential forms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>We can see how difficult your journey had been following your ideas. Did the situation get better at a later stage?</strong></span></p>
<p>Fortunately, during the 1990’s and into the new century, Professor Hestenes was successful at drawing considerable new interest to the area among computer scientists and engineers, by utilizing GA in an innovative way to lay down the foundations of projective and conformal geometries.</p>
<p>In 1990 I accepted a very promising offer by Professor Jaime Keller of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico to work with him as Assistant Editor of the new International Journal that he was creating, “Advances in Applied Clifford Algebras”, with the hope of both consolidating this growing field of research, and promoting wider international recognition. It was an exciting two years of growth, and of discovering the exotic culture of modern Mexico, alongside the ancient Mayan civilization that may well have been among the earliest to invent the concept of the number zero, and a base 20 type number system.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/bookcover1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2359" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/bookcover1-200x300.jpg" alt="bookcover1" width="200" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/bookcover1-200x300.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/bookcover1-768x1154.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/bookcover1-681x1024.jpg 681w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/bookcover1.jpg 827w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a>At the Universidad de Las Americas &#8211; Puebla, over the years 1993 &#8211; present, I continued to develop material for teaching GA at the undergraduate level, with an emphasis on basic linear algebra and elementary differential geometry, leading to the publication of my book, “New Foundations in Mathematics: The Geometric Concept of Number”, Birkhauser-Springer 2013. In this book, I emphasize the development of linear algebra and basic ideas of differential geometry in terms of GA, including the basic concept of the spectral basis. The idea of a spectral basis is what really connects the ideas of a geometric algebra to the traditional approaches to linear algebra and ubiquitous matrices. When GA is properly understood as providing a geometric basis for matrices, the well-established consistency of matrix algebra, in turn, proves the mathematical soundness of GA, without the need to go into more complicated arguments involving tensor analysis and the higher level abstract concepts of advanced mathematics. Also, in the book, I lay down preliminary material on application of the idea of a spectral basis in basic ideas in numerical analysis, such as Hermite interpolation and rational approximation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Present and Future</h3>
<p><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>How do you see the current state of GA and GC among researchers?</strong></span></p>
<p>Clifford analysis, as developed by various groups, both in the United States and Europe enjoys recognition as a respectable area of research in advanced mathematics. In addition to the work of Professor Hestenes, Professor Baylis in Canada, other researchers in Mexico, China and around the World, geometric algebra has enjoyed increasing success among theoretical physicists in relativity and quantum mechanics. Clifford algebra is also used by some of the top theoretical physicists at prestigious universities in string theory and its generalizations. As you know, it has also attracted significant and growing attention in the computer science and engineering communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>What are your expectations of the future of GA and GC in teaching? What kind of research do you believe should be conducted to effectively relate GA and GC to mainstream mathematics and applications?</strong></span></p>
<p>I have no easy answer to this question. One of the main obstacles to teaching GA is the lack of powerful computer software to aid and check abstract hand calculations, although many new software products are becoming available. Two software packages that I have found to be useful in my teaching and research is the original stand-alone early numerical software package “CLICAL” by Lounesto, and the Mexican developed Mathematica Package [cliffordt.nb] 2007, by G. Aragon-Camarasa, J.L. Aragon, and M.A. Rodriguez. There are quite are a number of recent attempts to introduce GA at the undergraduate level that I am aware of. However, GA is still hardly recognized at all at the undergraduate level, as I firmly believe that it should be. I believe that it is the natural completion of the concept of number to include the concept of direction, and it should be taught that way down into the high school level. It is in this area that I have concentrated my own efforts. There is much left to be done to correctly lay down the foundations, even at a fundamental level, in order to facilitate progress at progressively more advanced levels in mathematics, physics, computer science, and engineering, including diverse areas such as quantum computing, robotics, the structure Lie groups and Lie Algebras, and artificial intelligence. The future lies in the hands of the younger generations.</p>
