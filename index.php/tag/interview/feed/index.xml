<p>In this post, I interview Dr. Alan Macdonald who talks about his experience with both subjects and how he contributes in educating young undergraduate students about them through his books and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCymE67THrWoeTABxzJm1wdg/playlists" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online videos</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/macdonald.jpeg" data-rel="lightbox-1" title=""><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2757" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/macdonald-233x300.jpeg" alt="Dr. Alan Macdonald" width="233" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/macdonald-233x300.jpeg 233w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/macdonald.jpeg 273w" sizes="(max-width: 233px) 100vw, 233px" /></a><a href="http://faculty.luther.edu/~macdonal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Alan Macdonald</a> is Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at Luther College in Decorah Iowa. He received a Ph.D. in mathematics from The University of Michigan in 1970. His research interests include geometric algebra and the foundations of physics.</p>
<p>Dr. Alan is the author of two excellent books that introduce Geometric Algebra and Geometric Calculus to undergraduate students. In his first book <a href="http://faculty.luther.edu/~macdonal/laga/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Linear and Geometric Algebra</strong></em></a>, he develops the first undergraduate text to cover the essentials of linear algebra and its extension to geometric algebra. Prof. David Hestenes commented on his first book saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>I commend Alan Macdonald for his excellent book! His exposition is clean and spare. He has done a fine job of engineering a gradual transition from standard views of linear algebra to the perspective of geometric algebra. The book is sufficiently conventional to be adopted as a textbook by an adventurous teacher without getting flack from colleagues. Yet it leads to gems of geometric algebra that are likely to delight thoughtful students and surprise even the most experienced instructors.</p></blockquote>
<p>His second book <a href="http://faculty.luther.edu/~macdonal/vagc/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Vector and Geometric Calculus</strong></em></a> distinguishes itself from similar books on advanced calculus by two attributes: its thoroughgoing use of Geometric Algebra and the clarity of its exposition at an undergraduate level.</p>
<hr />
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Tell us about your life work in mathematics. What motivations and goals drove you through your research and teaching career? What obstacles did you face and how did you overcome them?</strong></span></p>
<p>I have taught and published in several different areas of mathematics and physics. I faced no serious obstacles in pursuing my varied interests (except to find more than 24 hours in a day). Lucky!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Tell us about what got you interested in Geometric Algebra. As a mathematician, what kinds of ideas in physics and geometry do you find naturally expressible using GA?</strong></span></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/cranium-2099129_640.png" data-rel="lightbox-2" title=""><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2776" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/cranium-2099129_640-300x187.png" alt="Exchange Ideas" width="300" height="187" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/cranium-2099129_640-300x187.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/cranium-2099129_640.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>I read strong claims about geometric algebra and decided to look for myself. I was smitten. I found that geometric algebra and its extension to geometric calculus unify, simplify, and generalize vast areas of mathematics involving geometric ideas, including linear algebra, vector calculus, complex analysis, exterior algebra and calculus, tensor algebra and calculus, quaternions (3D spinors), and euclidean, non-euclidean, and projective geometries. I also found that GA provides a common mathematical language for many areas of physics (classical and quantum mechanics, electrodynamics, special and general relativity), computer science (graphics, robotics, computer vision), engineering, and other fields. People in disparate fields can now talk to each other!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Some people say &#8220;Why should we learn and use GA when we already have many mathematical tools that work?&#8221;. How do you respond to this kind of question?</strong></span></p>
<p>My response: <em><strong>Geometric algebra unifies many of your mathematical tools and works better than any of them</strong>.</em> Unfortunately, this has not been sufficient to induce many to switch. GA takes time to learn. And once learned, there is the problem of communicating with others who haven&#8217;t learned. Nevertheless, geometric algebra is gaining adherents, slowly but surely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Tell us about the relation between Geometric Algebra and Linear Algebra. Can the basic ideas of linear algebra be reformulated using GA? How is that? What are the benefits of such reformulations and developments?</strong></span></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Angular-Momentum-Bivector-and-Pseudovector.png" data-rel="lightbox-3" title=""><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2778" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Angular-Momentum-Bivector-and-Pseudovector-300x205.png" alt="Angular Momentum Bivector and Pseudovector" width="300" height="205" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Angular-Momentum-Bivector-and-Pseudovector-300x205.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Angular-Momentum-Bivector-and-Pseudovector.png 512w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Geometric algebra is a superset of linear algebra, with more objects, multivectors, and more operations; for example, the geometric product. So anything that linear algebra can do geometric algebra can do. Even within linear algebra, geometric algebra brings advantages. Here is a simple example. Consider the orthogonal complement of a subspace: the set of vectors orthogonal to all vectors in the subspace. For both linear and geometric algebra this <strong><em>geometric</em> </strong>definition tells us what the orthogonal complement <strong><em>is</em></strong>. Geometric algebra adds algebra, providing a very simple way to <strong><em>compute</em> </strong>the complement (as a dual), something linear algebra can&#8217;t do. This illustrates the name <em><strong>Geometric Algebra</strong></em>: it does geometry algebraically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Prof. David Hestenes talked in one of his lectures about your first undergraduates GA book and how it could have been a joint project. In what aspects does your vision for introducing GA to students relate to his?</strong></span></p>
<p>I share David Hestenes&#8217; vision of wide acceptance of GA and the advantages this will bring.</p>
<p>A vital aspect of making this happen is encouraging and enabling GA&#8217;s inclusion in the undergraduate mathematics curriculum. The only way that mathematics faculties will consider this is to have available GA texts written in traditional mathematics textbook style. This is my small contribution to Hestenes&#8217; vision.</p>
<p>Mathematicians have been infuriatingly slow in becoming interested in geometric algebra. We are repeating the short-sightedness of 120 years ago when <em><strong>Engineers welcomed Gibbs&#8217;s and Heaviside&#8217;s vector analysis, though the mathematicians did not</strong> </em><sup class='endnote'><a href='#en-2731-1' id='enref-2731-1' onclick='return hhEndnotes_show(2731)'>1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>What kind of software tools do you think should be used in explaining GA and GC to undergraduate students? Are there any missing features you would like to see in current tools?</strong></span></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Sympy-160px.png" data-rel="lightbox-4" title=""><img class="alignright wp-image-2774" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Sympy-160px-300x300.png" alt="SymPy" width="227" height="227" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Sympy-160px-300x300.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Sympy-160px-150x150.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Sympy-160px-160x160.png 160w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Sympy-160px-320x320.png 320w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Sympy-160px.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 227px) 100vw, 227px" /></a>I chose <a href="http://docs.sympy.org/0.7.0/modules/galgebra/GA/GAsympy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alan Bromborsky&#8217;s GAlgebra</a> for my texts because it is free, it is multiplatform, it does <strong><em>symbolic</em> </strong>calculations, and it is well designed. But it is far from everything I could ask for: its syntax for expressions is sometimes awkward; it requires several other programs, e.g., Python, making installation difficult for some; and it has no graphics capability.</p>
<p>I would like to see a program with GAlgebra&#8217;s strengths but not its shortcomings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>What are your expectations of the future of GA &amp; GC in teaching?</strong></span></p>
<p>My experience is in teaching undergraduate mathematics in the United States, so I will speak to that. Students typically take a year of scalar calculus in their first year of college, then courses in linear algebra and vector calculus in their second year.</p>
<p>The most natural place to introduce GA &amp; GC is right after scalar calculus. I believe that the current second-year linear algebra and vector calculus courses should be renamed <em>Geometric Algebra</em> and <em>Geometric Calculus</em>, their purpose being to provide the basic vocabulary of mathematics in dimensions greater than one. By judiciously trimming the current courses and taking advantage of the simplifications of GA &amp; GC, a lot of GA &amp; GC can be covered. My two textbooks <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Geometric-Algebra-Alan-Macdonald/dp/1453854932" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Linear and Geometric Algebra</em></a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Geometric-Calculus-Alan-Macdonald/dp/1480132454/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=1480132454&amp;pd_rd_r=YMSWSBWDXT255WXMRTN6&amp;pd_rd_w=PZx9C&amp;pd_rd_wg=p6xhV&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=YMSWSBWDXT255WXMRTN6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Vector and Geometric Calculus</em></a> are attempts at this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Tell us about the mathematical developments you think are still necessary for GA &amp; GC to take their rightful place as the primary mathematical modeling language for this century. What kind of research should be conducted to effectively relate GA &amp; GC to mainstream mathematics and applications?</strong></span></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2000px-Triple_Integral_Example_2.svg_.png" data-rel="lightbox-5" title=""><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2775" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2000px-Triple_Integral_Example_2.svg_-300x300.png" alt="Triple Integral Example" width="300" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2000px-Triple_Integral_Example_2.svg_-300x300.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2000px-Triple_Integral_Example_2.svg_-150x150.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2000px-Triple_Integral_Example_2.svg_-768x768.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2000px-Triple_Integral_Example_2.svg_-1024x1024.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2000px-Triple_Integral_Example_2.svg_-160x160.png 160w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2000px-Triple_Integral_Example_2.svg_-320x320.png 320w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>GA &amp; GC are well developed at the elementary level, ready for use. But there are problems to be solved before they can take their rightful place.</p>
<p>We face a chicken and egg problem: students must learn GA &amp; GC to apply them, and those applying vector methods, but not brought up on GA &amp; GC, must push for their inclusion in the curriculum. And if students learn GA &amp; GC in their second year, this cannot be a dead end: instructors in later courses must use them in their courses. Another problem: people are reluctant to publish using a mathematical formalism unknown to most. We can only do our best, making incremental progress until a critical mass is achieved.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he area of <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_visualization" target="_blank">Scientific Visualization</a> (SciViz)</strong> is an interdisciplinary branch of science. According to <a href="http://www.math.yorku.ca/SCS/Gallery/milestone/milestone.pdf" target="_blank">Friendly</a>, it is &#8220;primarily concerned with the visualization of three-dimensional phenomena (architectural, meteorological, medical, biological, etc.), where the emphasis is on realistic renderings of volumes, surfaces, illumination sources, and so forth, perhaps with a dynamic (time) component&#8221;. It is also considered a subset of computer graphics, a branch of computer science. The purpose of scientific visualization is to graphically illustrate scientific data to enable scientists to understand, illustrate, and glean insight from their data.</p>
<p>In this post, I interview Dr. Werner Benger who describes his views on SciViz using Geometric Algebra and provides valuable insights about the use of SciViz in Big Data applications.</p>

<li>Presentation (when all is known about the data),</li>
<li>Analysis (when some questions need to be answered about the data),</li>
<li>Exploration (when we have no clue about the data yet and want to find out something new).</li>
</ul>
<p>Although user interface design is not necessarily part of SciViz, but in many cases, interactivity is needed. Particularly important is that the data that one deals with here are those with a spatio-temporal nature, it&#8217;s not just &#8220;any&#8221; data, but this specific subset.</p>
<p>Actually, I would not say that I have chosen to work in SciViz. It&#8217;s more that SciViz has chosen me. For most of the time I&#8217;ve considered myself rather an astrophysicist that became &#8220;delinquent&#8221; by engaging with computers too much. The origin came from the question how a black hole actually looks like. I asked that questions to one of my professors at university and he could not answer it, so I had to find out myself. I wrote a computer program for that purpose and that got me into this field. A couple of years ago I gave a presentation to students telling this story, you can find <a href="https://www.cct.lsu.edu/~werner/4REU2010.pdf" target="_blank">the presentation slides here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Do you see significant differences between Engineering and Computer Science when trying to solve practical problems?</strong></span></p>
<p>As you mention Engineering vs. Computer Science &#8211; I often feel the difference between these two is that in Engineering you worry to get things to work &#8220;somehow&#8221;, while in Computer Science you also worry how things are getting to work and you want to find a systematic, future-safe approach. I&#8217;m myself more behind this theoretical approach to finding a powerful general solution that also but not only works for a special case, rather than just solving one particular special case. I also want to know why things work or why things cannot work, rather than finding an algorithm that solves a problem &#8220;somehow&#8221;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>What major branches of Engineering and Computer Science are directly related to SciViz research and applications?</strong></span></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Fields.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-3" title=""><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2659" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Fields-300x107.jpg" alt="Fields" width="300" height="107" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Fields-300x107.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Fields.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>My own approach to scientific visualization is focusing on finding general methods that allow encapsulation and reuse of code and algorithms. Computer programmers are inherently lazy people; otherwise, they would not use computers. I&#8217;m no exception for that, and particularly lazy such that I want to implement an algorithm or data operation once, and not over and over again for similar data types. Consequently what is needed is one common concept that covers many cases under the same hood. I found that to be true through my background in astrophysics in General Relativity (GR); since this theory makes many otherwise implicit assumptions explicit.</p>
<p>The same is also true about Geometric Algebra, which &#8220;unfolds&#8221; otherwise collapsed mathematical entities, such as vectors and bivectors, and clearly states the properties of each object in a systematic way. So it is this unfolding and clarification of concepts via GA and GR (namely differential geometry and topology) that opens the path to a common data model that is powerful and reusable for those many cases that one encounters in scientific visualization. It is an overhead for a particular case, so many people who do their work under time-pressure or a close horizon don&#8217;t see the benefit of a more general data model, but in the longer term it is significantly less work and opens development resources towards more interesting topics rather than dealing with myriads of similar cases. Here is an article titled &#8220;<a href="https://www.computer.org/cms/Computer.org/ComputingNow/homepage/2009/1109/rW_CS_SafariFileFormatJungle.pdf" target="_blank">On Safari in the File Format Jungle</a>&#8221; that elaborates on this matter.</p>
<p>Systematic scientific visualization fuses all those interesting mathematical fields of differential geometry, topology, and geometric algebra. SciViz is also on the bridge between artwork and science, so touching both aspects is what many want, but only SciViz achieves if done well. You can read more about this aspect in my article &#8220;<a href="http://www.zib.de/hege/pdf/Benger-1999-Visions-of-numerical-relativity_SC-99-53.pdf" target="_blank">Visions of Numerical Relativity 1999</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">What recent SciViz developments you find most important that you can tell us about?</span></strong></p>
<p>Concerning new developments &#8211; that is certainly &#8220;Big Data&#8221;, which has become a buzzword that is all around now. With more and advanced numerical and observation technology available, the trend is to no longer filter data during generation, but to just retrieve and store anything possible, leaving the crucial problem of identifying &#8211; i.e., visualizing &#8211; the important aspects of the data to the last data processing step, the visualization. This is a topic by itself of course, but just to mention that Big Data is often considered synonymous with High-Performance Computing (HPC). Actually, SciViz only covers one aspect of HPC, but indeed many methods and approaches from HPC are needed to deal with SciViz, even on single PCs and laptops. There it is of course all about parallelism, about GPU computing, about parallel I/O, and about scaling up algorithms to deal with bigger amounts of data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Tell us about the relations between Geometric Computing (GC) and SciViz. How does SciViz benefit from developments in GC and the other way around? </strong></span></p>
<p>Geometric Computing is a tool that is used in SciViz to solve its various detail problems. It&#8217;s frequent that in SciViz you want to achieve something and you need to search for the best GC algorithm to solve it. For the other way around, SciViz may help to develop a GC algorithm as it allows visual insight to what actually happens during the algorithm, not merely the result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>What benefits can Geometric Algebra provide in this context for both domains? Do you find everyone agreeing with your point of view on using GA?</strong></span></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/isostream03.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-4" title=""><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2655" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/isostream03-300x236.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="236" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/isostream03-300x236.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/isostream03-768x605.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/isostream03.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>I always try to solve a GC problem via GA since GA is much richer in expressiveness than linear algebra and the chances that a seemingly complex algorithm can be solved by some simple but powerful elements taken out of a GA &#8220;toolbox&#8221; are high. Once you are used to thinking in terms of GA, things become easier that way, and thinking in terms of linear algebra feels like a knot in the brain. Like when talking about a &#8220;normal vector&#8221;, which is not really a vector, it&#8217;s merely identified with a vector, but what is actually a better representation is a bivector algebraically describing a plane&#8217;s direction in space.</p>
<p>This sometimes leads to passionate discussions with colleagues who still think about geometry in linear algebra and wonder how to rotate around an axis in 3D, when it&#8217;s so much easier to think about a rotation in a plane spun by two vectors. Such GA-based representation does not require any thinking, you &#8220;just do it&#8221;. But it is so hard for people to think about a bivector when talking about a plane if they are used to think about a plane&#8217;s normal vector instead, which in fact is a construct involving orthogonality and orientation, much more complex than the original object, the plane itself.</p>
<p>But then, even GA complicates matters by considering bivectors as oriented planes, but there&#8217;s not really a concept of a plane &#8220;as-is&#8221;, i.e. without orientation. That is something that can be borrowed from differential geometry as a covector, an unoriented plane, which by means of using an orientation (via the pseudoscalar) is identifiable with a bivector, then describing an oriented plane. And all those items are identified in linear vector algebra with the same object, a three-component vector.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s a bit of matter of taste which side is more confusing, the one identifying different geometric concepts into the same algebraic representation, or the one that unfolds a widely used geometric concept into more expressive algebraic objects. For my taste, the latter, and the more you have unfolded those geometric concepts, the better you understand which algebraic structures are required for identification &#8211; and those structures may be non-trivial in general, thus need to be considered explicitly in a general-purpose data model, even though via various optimization techniques they would vanish. This should be the last step, not the first one. &#8220;Implicit assumptions&#8221; are the death of data descriptions and file formats, there must at least be a way to identify which assumptions have been made, and they need to be part of the data description.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>What is the importance of embedding the assumptions into Big Data descriptions and file formats? How can we approach this effectively?</strong></span></p>
<p>When we classify algebraic properties of geometric concepts we obtain a &#8220;zoo&#8221; of vector types. This determines the metadata that needs to be written to a file (or other means of persistent storage such as a database) such that the data remain identifiable. Just writing floating point data is simple, but problems occur when the need arises to know what the data mean when reading them. Self-description of data is important for archival purposes and restartable algorithms, which are particularly important for long-term archiving and out-of-memory data processing. There are not many file formats that even provide the required expressivity of meta-data as required for this purpose to describe such variety of vectorial types.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/TensorFibers-F5Logo.png" data-rel="lightbox-5" title=""><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2657" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/TensorFibers-F5Logo.png" alt="TensorFibers-F5Logo" width="256" height="256" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/TensorFibers-F5Logo.png 256w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/TensorFibers-F5Logo-150x150.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/TensorFibers-F5Logo-160x160.png 160w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/TensorFibers-F5Logo-320x320.png 320w" sizes="(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px" /></a>XML is one option, especially in the web context, <strong><a href="https://www.hdfgroup.org/" target="_blank">HDF5</a></strong> is another one, designed for high-performance applications and big data. While via XML anything is in the open, in HDF5 there already is an API to describe the properties of types. In Addition, HDF5 provides functionality of type conversions, which in this context can be utilized to e.g. implicitly convert multivectors of different numerical precision or to read a partial multivector into full multivector (for instance, if data were written by an application that only knows about vectors, but later on these data are read into another application that only knows about full multivectors).</p>
<p>For a generic application, we need runtime type identification that maps a type description, may it be provided by HDF5 or another capable file format \ storage medium, into compile-time types such that the correct precompiled code for the respective vector types can be called. On the other hand, the I/O mechanisms should not need to know about the complexity of vector types, it only needs to know about arrays of floating points plus some metadata. Thus what is left is to map the compile-time type meta-information to some run-time meta-information about types. The mechanism of type traits comes into play here for writing data. For reading data, however, it is not sufficient. When a certain data type is identified in some persistent storage, the reading code has to look up some registry to find a routine that produces actual instances of data arrays of the given type (which is then known by application code only). Given such an application code produced data array, it remains sufficient for the reading code to look at its numerical values only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>As I understand, SciViz is a core part of any practical simulator. In your opinion, what are the software engineering methods most suitable for designing and implementing scalable SciViz software components and systems? </strong></span></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Streamlines_Multiblock6.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-6" title=""><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2650" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Streamlines_Multiblock6-300x188.jpg" alt="Streamlines_Multiblock6" width="300" height="188" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Streamlines_Multiblock6-300x188.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Streamlines_Multiblock6-768x480.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Streamlines_Multiblock6.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Well, in theory, it&#8217;s a complementary part of simulation; in practice many scientists performing 3D or 4D simulations still only look at numbers or 1D plots. This is partly due to &#8220;old-style&#8221; scientists being used to 1D plots, as this was the only way of &#8220;visualization&#8221; decades ago, and color printing of images with 3D visualizations is not possible in traditional high-profile journals where they want to publish. The other problem is the inconvenience of dealing with big data and advanced visualization systems. While there are lots of fancy visualization equipment such as Caves and Walls, only very few would make use of such. The typical scientist would not make use of anything that doesn&#8217;t run on their laptops right away. Even going to another room for doing visualization on a higher-end machine is too much overhead for many &#8220;end-users&#8221; and they would not do it unless they are forced to.</p>
<p>For design and engineering of SciViz software, I&#8217;m an advocator for using a common data model. I.e., use one central data structure to route as many types of data through this one, instead of cooking many little solutions that may or may not fit together.</p>
<p>Concerning code readability, I believe code should be written in a most intuitive way; mathematical algorithms as close to the mathematical notation as possible. For example, operator overloading and C++ 14 string literals provide syntactic sugar to do so, but a naive implementation may suffer performance issues. Expression templates have demonstrated how human-readable code can be transformed into efficient code by using C++ templates. The more constraints are known about some code, the better it can be optimized, and systems such as Gaalop or GMac that rely on symbolic algebra packages may be able to optimize a certain algorithm even better than the more generic C++ compiler. It is thus desirable that a C++ library providing GA algorithm allows for application code that is not only human-readable but also readable as a domain-specific language such that it is parseable by tools beyond the C++ compiler itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>How can GA be useful in this software design context? Are there any difficulties associated with using GA here?</strong></span></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Software-Design.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-7" title=""><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2651" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Software-Design-300x105.jpg" alt="Software Design" width="300" height="105" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Software-Design-300x105.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Software-Design-768x269.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Software-Design.jpg 970w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>GA is as helpful here in software design as it is helpful in bridging different mathematical applications, by showing a common, unifying basis. The difficulty here is similar to using a common data model: we need the most general possible way of considering GA, not merely a version of GA for one particular case, even though that one may be very broadly used.</p>
<p>For instance, this means considering GA in arbitrary coordinate systems, not merely in orthonormal coordinate systems, which is what most implementations of GA do &#8211; because mathematically, it can be done, and the problem is solved thereby. But it&#8217;s only mathematically solved, and in practice, non-orthonormal coordinate systems are more common; for instance in numerical relativity or in computational fluid dynamic simulations. GA-based implementations need to be as general as possible to cover all such applications that can use GA as an algebraic representation. At the same time, we need to keep the highly optimized reductions that are possible for special cases, and at this time some automatic code generators may come into play to allow specifying constraints and knowledge available for a particular use case (e.g. global orthonormality of coordinates) which are not available on the level of a compiler.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>How do you think designing GA-based SciViz software, like your Vish Shell, for Big Data processing can be different from small scale GC applications?</strong></span></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/VishConcept.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-8" title=""><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2649" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/VishConcept-300x279.jpg" alt="Vish Concept" width="300" height="279" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/VishConcept-300x279.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/VishConcept.jpg 482w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>A certain difference is that one must avoid any overhead &#8220;per vector element&#8221; and consider doing operations on &#8220;arrays of multivectors&#8221;. This comes with constraints that need to be taken into consideration. Vish stems from a background of dealing with big data from numerical relativity and bases all its data operations on the concept of fiber bundles. This means operations are done as array operations as much as possible, which are parallelizable and allow optimal data throughput, for both I/O and transferring data on the graphics card for rendering. Modern rendering is based on vertex buffers and vertex arrays, which mathematically are fiber bundles, whereas the old OpenGL 1.0 was about primitives and lists of primitives. This model did not scale to the highly parallel data processing that happens on GPUs and thus is considered deprecated now, whereas the fiber bundle data model, envisioned originally by D. Butler in 1989, shines, even though only a few people are aware that they actually do fiber bundles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>What role does GA have in such Big-Data software design context?</strong></span></p>
<p>In this context, GA is complementary, as it basically implements fibers on the fiber bundle data model. So the basic change is to think about operations on arrays of multivectors and to extend solutions to consider array operations instead of single variables. Now that &#8220;should&#8221; be rather easy when an array of multivectors is homogenous, i.e. each array element consists of multivectors with the same zero and non-zero components. Fortunately, this will most likely be the case in practical applications, and code-generators such as GMac are able to predict which multivector components will always be zero within an algorithm &#8211; that is an essential part of applying GA algorithms for big data, both for computational speed and even more memory consumption.</p>
<p>For a single input operation, optimizing out zeroes is just some computational optimization, but the algorithm would still work without it. For big data having many inputs, keeping arrays which are all zero are performance killers and may prevent an entire application from becoming functional. So an optional optimization for small data applications becomes a mandatory component for big data applications. But things become really complex if we had to consider heterogeneous multivector arrays where the zeros would be different at each array element. This basically leaves us with two options: Carry all zeroes everywhere for the sake of parallelism, or use locally dynamic multivectors, which will be much slower but more memory-friendly. Let&#8217;s hope we don&#8217;t have many such application cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Can you tell us about other interesting aspects of Vish?</strong></span></p>
<p>I would like to point out that Vish is adhering to <a href="http://vish.fiberbundle.net/download/license/" target="_blank">a particular license with a non-military aspect</a>. I think it&#8217;s important for developers of technology to also think how their technology can be used. Otherwise, the Oppenheimer effect may strike them later on. Many people would object, and promote &#8220;free software&#8221; just for the sake of freedom, saying the military would not respect a software license anyway. However, my experience on that matter has been just the opposite. It is respected, and I had a couple of requests from the military that I was putting down, and it was accepted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>You mentioned earlier that most scientists don&#8217;t like to use advanced SciViz tools often. What can we do in terms of educating and training new generations of researchers to change this? Can GA provide help in solving this problem?</strong></span></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Rayleigh-Taylor_instability.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-9" title=""><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2662" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Rayleigh-Taylor_instability-300x300.jpg" alt="Rayleigh-Taylor_instability" width="300" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Rayleigh-Taylor_instability-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Rayleigh-Taylor_instability-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Rayleigh-Taylor_instability-160x160.jpg 160w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Rayleigh-Taylor_instability-320x320.jpg 320w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Rayleigh-Taylor_instability.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>This is a good and unsolved question. Actually, I don&#8217;t think much can be done to change the mind of current researchers, but new ones will embrace new technology in a natural way, similar to kids growing up with smartphones, while their grandparents still disapproving them. Parts of the process is due to the technology not just becoming functional, but also easy and available to use.</p>
<p>There is not much point of trying to &#8220;force&#8221; users into some technology, that is not really sustainable, but there are many people out there that would want to make their technology to be used and available, yet they struggle with the simple issue of obtaining funding for it, because in the scientific world, you don&#8217;t get papers and publications for making your software easier to use. It&#8217;s more the scientific publication culture, or rather, using &#8220;scientific publications&#8221; as a measure for funding agencies that inhibits making such tools easier. SciViz, in particular, has the problem that everyone wants and likes glossy images to present and sell their work, but hardly anyone wants to invest resources into it or pay for it. There are few exceptions, for instance, I heard about research centers with the policy that 10% of all project budgets must be allocated for doing visualization; this is a great model. By that model, even projects that don&#8217;t need visualization contribute to visualization research and deployment. With a proper funding model for SciViz development and supplementing, development and increased use of advanced SciViz tools will come naturally.</p>
<p>On the other hand, GA is more an educational topic, it does not really help to understand a data analysis in its entity, it could only help to understand a certain data analysis tool or method, to see what it does. But understanding the data itself is independent, and that is up to the scientist who produced the data to determine whether GA is of benefit in this step. But similar to SciViz tools, there is no point of trying to enforce or promote GA to those who don&#8217;t want it, but those who don&#8217;t know it yet should be made aware that it exists and what it is good for, and that should be done as early as possible in someone&#8217;s learning career. Of course, the problem is that it comes with a choice &#8211; it can be used or not, so to not burden people with unnecessary mental ballast, it would not be taught early on. But at least, it should be mentioned, so people inspired by it can look it up themselves.</p>

<h3>Geographical Information Science</h3>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Geographical Information Science (GIS) is a fascinating field of research, tell us about it and its impact on our lives.</strong></span></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/1024px-1941_China_from_the_East.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-1" title=""><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2308" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/1024px-1941_China_from_the_East-300x188.jpg" alt="China From the East" width="300" height="188" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/1024px-1941_China_from_the_East-300x188.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/1024px-1941_China_from_the_East-768x480.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/1024px-1941_China_from_the_East.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Geography is the study of the earth and its’ features, inhabitants, and phenomena, which is a discipline system studying the interaction, changes and spatial difference in all spheres of earth surface system. So, about 80% of everyday information is strongly related to the geographic position, and can all be called Geographic information.</p>
<p>GIS is a comprehensive technology system used for collecting, processing, management, analysis, expression and transmission of geographic information. The strong capabilities of data analysis and processing make GIS like the brain of Geography. Therefore, GIS can be a key platform not only for Geography research but also for social services. Until now, GIS is applied to various areas like resource investigation, environmental assessment, disaster prediction, land management, transportation, military police, water conservancy and so on.</p>
<p>To a country, GIS is closely linked to national development and security. For example, when first Gulf War broke out, the US military had won a decisive victory at a modest price, hitting the Iraqi army with a precise strike. The City GIS system of Iraqi, which is built with the help of U.S., provides critical battlefield geographic information to the U.S., largely determining the outcome of the war.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/14656314348_f3aa8acb78_b.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-2" title=""><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2309" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/14656314348_f3aa8acb78_b-300x225.jpg" alt="China Taxi" width="300" height="225" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/14656314348_f3aa8acb78_b-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/14656314348_f3aa8acb78_b-768x576.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/14656314348_f3aa8acb78_b.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>To industry applications, GIS undoubtedly enhances the production efficiency. Let’s take China’s logistics industry as an example. GIS established a perfect management system for it, which includes supply management, personnel management, path planning and so on. So, everyone can sit at home to buy all the things from Internet and then get your commodities after one or two days. To everyone’s daily life, “Uber Taxi” may be one of the best examples of GIS applications. People can search the taxi at service nearby, plan the route to your own destination with real-time calculated prices and query for interest points around all by smartphones, which profoundly changes the way travel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>What other major branches of Engineering and Computer Science are directly related to GIS applications?</strong></span></p>
<p>GIS is an interdisciplinary science and makes use of many advanced achievements of Engineering and Computer Science. The major branches directly related to GIS applications I think are Topography, Graphics, Data Science and High-performance heterogeneous computing. Topography provides the data source and measurement calculation methods to GIS, and Data Science instructs the data storage, management, and analysis process of GIS data models. Graphics provides strong tools for GIS visualization. At last, High-performance heterogeneous computing gives GIS an efficient method for calculating, which is the energy of GIS applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Geometry of Our World</h3>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Tell us about the deep relations between Geometric Computing and GIS.</span> </strong></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/General_view_terrahs.png" data-rel="lightbox-3" title=""><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2310" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/General_view_terrahs-300x195.png" alt="GIS" width="300" height="195" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/General_view_terrahs-300x195.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/General_view_terrahs.png 538w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>According to the characteristics of GIS mentioned above, geographical objects expression and computation based on Euclidean geometry are highly dependent on object coordinates and coordinate systems and the expression and analysis of different dimensional geographical objects are at disunity. So, we need to find out a corresponding unified coordinate system to represent the geographical objects of a different scale from global to local. In GIS, we are not only studying the geographical objects but also the geographical phenomena and geographical process. Geographical phenomena and process are usually characterized as multidimensional features and span many different spatio-temporal scales. Moreover, as the fusion analysis of geometric objects with different dimensions, it is rather difficult to be linked and integrated effectively with geographical models. All in all, in GIS, we have got a lot of multi-source heterogeneous data which is referenced as geometry and developed much more analysis models which are referenced as algebra, but they cannot be integrated appropriately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>So what benefits can Geometric Algebra provide in this context?</strong></span></p>
<p>Based on philosophical and physical considerations, it seems that only Geometry Algebra can solve these problems effectively. As a unified descriptive language, GA can connect algebra and geometry, mathematics and physics, abstract space-time and entity space-time. So, introducing GA to GIS has a prospective to improve the multidimensional expression and analysis ability of GIS.</p>
<p>Products in GA define spatial operation sets as geometries, measurements, topologies and directions, and have the ability to achieve expression and mutual transformation among various kinds of space, and thus support unification and expression of various algebra and geometric system. Under the GA framework, operation rules and operators are designed to support the complex geometric calculation, in order to construct GIS computing engine based on GA.</p>
<p>The ability of geometric computation and expression in GA makes time an equivalent dimension to space in computational space construction, thus the expression and computation of unified time and space are achieved. For example, if we want to track a ship moving in the ocean together with cameras (optical remote sensing), sonar (acoustic remote sensing) and radar (electromagnetic remote sensing), we have to deal with images, waves, and fields with different speeds through very large scales, we need to integrate different spatio-temporal references. And classical Euclidean geometry will be invalid for this situation due to numerical computational precision. However, with GA, we can easily deal with this situation using frame-based representations and versors like what we have already done in spacetime algebra.</p>
<p>GA intrinsically mixes the dimensional computation of definite geometric meaning, achieves integrative expression and storage of objects of different dimensions in mathematical structures, and supports expression, modeling, and analysis of complex geographical phenomena and geographical process.</p>
<p>GIS data models and analysis models can also be extended in GA framework, which will help to build a unified descriptive framework of multidimensional geographical time and space. Besides, present analysis models and algorithms such as statistical model, dynamic model, and differential equation model can be inherited and unified to support geographical models and compact integration of GIS analysis and geographical analysis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Simulations</h3>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>As I understand, simulation plays a fundamental role in GIS research and applications. In your opinion, what are the difficulties of creating good GIS simulators?</strong></span></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/vendeeglobe.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-4" title=""><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2311" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/vendeeglobe-300x188.jpg" alt="GIS Simulators" width="300" height="188" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/vendeeglobe-300x188.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/vendeeglobe-768x480.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/vendeeglobe.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>The real world is complex, so does the geographic information obtained from the world. GIS is considered as a common platform, which needs a spatio-temporal coordinate system, static or dynamic state, and geographical phenomena or process. This condition leads to the huge amount of heterogeneous data, geometric or algebraic expressions, and analysis models. So, the difficulties of creating good GIS simulators I think maybe in four aspects:</p>
<p>(1) How to develop a unified spatio-temporal framework that can integrate geographical objects, phenomenon and geoscience data at different scales with different characteristics? How to make the translation and coupling of the global spatio-temporal framework/reference with a local or several local frameworks/references seamlessly.</p>
<p>(2) How to develop an efficient scene-based data model that can not only have enough power to represent real geographic objects/phenomenon in a parametric way but also can support efficient organization, storage, computation and visualization in current computer framework.</p>
<p>(3) How to integrate users with different requirements (e.g. geographer, common publics, policy makers, developers and computer scientists) with a common, flexible but powerful expression and computation language, which can both easy use but also efficient for dynamical computing.</p>
<p>(4) How to deal with dynamical simulation and continues data updating and visualization by coupling various different geographical models. How can we combine them in an integrating framework and make them work together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>How do you think GA can be used to create better GIS simulators?</strong></span></p>
<p>The above three conflicts all points to one thing: that a transmission tool is an urgent need. So, Geometric Algebra is found from the areas of mathematics and physics to act as a convergence tool. The unity of geometry and algebra, time and space, different dimensions, expression and computation of GA is just as the effective way to solve the existing problem.</p>
<p>In our past work, we have done the Multi-dimensional complex object expression based on Blade, the Multi-dimensional complex scenes expression based on Multivector, and the Multi-dimensional unified computation based on geometric algebra, which laid the foundation for the new GIS simulator through the data structure, expression, and calculation.</p>
<p>GA can effectively represent the relationship and measurement of different shapes, and Multivectors can realize the integration and unification of different dimensions and types of geometric objects. Then in the computation part, GA calculation is almost based on operators, which have good compatibility with various analysis models, such as dynamic model or differential equation model. A famous example is the expression of Maxwell’s equation, which can be transformed into a single equation by GA. So, to geographic computation, it’s of great significance to integrating and optimizing the existing models.</p>
<p>In the GA simulation, a series of compilers can be created to translate all these models into GA expressions, and then into the C++ codes, which improves the efficiency and reduces the computational complexity. On the basis of those compilers, high-performance heterogeneous parallel computing can also be easily realized. Above all, GA does the overall rebuild to the old simulators and makes GIS simulators more efficient, concise and smart.</p>

<h3>The Gathering</h3>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Tell us about your experiences in the recently organized 2016 conference Geometric Algebra and Geographical Information Science: Development and Applications (<a style="color: #000080;" href="http://dky.njnu.edu.cn/CAGIS2016/">GAGIS</a>). What were your expectations before the conference? What can you tell us about the conference benefits to both the GA and GIS communities?</strong></span></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/105313_298519.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-5" title=""><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2312" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/105313_298519-300x212.jpg" alt="Nanjing Normal University" width="300" height="212" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/105313_298519-300x212.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/105313_298519-768x544.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/105313_298519.jpg 836w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>In GAGIS, the most impressive thing for me is that all of the researchers had done excellent works in their research area. Because of the characteristics of GIS, It attracts people in many directions and fields. During the meeting, each researcher made a wonderful report and after the report, the participants put out a lot of questions and I also learned much about it from their response. On the last day of the meeting, we also visited the laboratory and learn about the wonderful work that they had done.</p>
<p>As a common platform, GIS has the potential to support the development and application of geometric algebra and its related fields as a representative work. For example, image processing can rely on the GIS platform to design the corresponding image processing algorithms and validate it directly with GIS data. However, until now, all we have done is primary, and we need to collaborate with the international GA and GIS related researchers. We also want to show our work to the international society and attract more researcher to join us, letting them collaborate with us under this framework.</p>
<p>Before the conference, I expected to learn more about geometric algebra in various fields of research and introduce our achievement to everyone in order to attract more intelligent people to join us. And now, it works. From the perspective of geography at home and abroad, GA is high-profile in GIS because of the characteristics of GIS itself. There are a series of teams doing the research about it and there are some projects supporting it. Unfortunately, international geometric algebra teams are relatively dispersed. How to unite this group of people to form a complete organization is the key point to promote the development and influence of GA. The most important thing that I want to say is that international conference is important to publicize what we do and strengthen communication, publicity, and cooperation. That is what we have never done before.</p>
